ees operational risk,"per our conversation , here is the model that i have for simon . the notes  that i gave you were from some work i did back in september as i was looking  for volume numbers . the notes show what drives the final cash flow numbers .  briefly , the issue surrounds exactly what is meant by nonmarket and  noncredit risk . ideally , this would be anything that effects npv of the  deal . however , i think that we should limit ourselves to those things that  effect the time and amount of the eam volumes . even here , such a problem set  is quite large . if you glance at the spreadsheet model , you will notice that  there exists a large number of possible items that effect the eam volumes .  if we are to do this rigorously , then it is necessary to tear apart ees ' s  business model , and although such an attempt to do so would be noble , the  scope of such an excercise may be too large . we need a clear definition of  ees operational risk .  briefly , from the ees deals that i have looked at , two things drive their  profit : a long term bet that power prices will go down , and that we can  improve the facility through various enhancements . each of these may be  gleaned from the spreadsheet , as well as the assumptions regarding the  funding of the facility improvements and so on . 95 % of the savings is  assumed to come from power , and 5 % from gas . ( the effeciency gain may not be  explicitly given ) . if we have data that show the realized efficiency gains ,  then it would be simple [ in principle ] to determine a distribution , and hence  a distribution of eam volumes , npv ' s , etc . at this time , i understand that  rac has determined some of the realized efficiency gains , but my knowledge is  quite sketchy . jay hachen may have more info .  if i get a chance , i will try to see if i can do a "" proof of concept ""  excercise , but i have a late january deadline on something else .  another point : even if we are successful in doing this for the spreadsheet  model , ees has chosen to book things differently . i do not have a thorough  understanding of their it systems , but at least in principle , if we can do  this for the spreadsheet model , then we can do it in their it environment  ( data are data are data ) . they may book efficiency gains through improvement  type , such as gains due to compressors , chillers , boilers , etc . if this is  indeed the case , then we need to have distributions for each type of  improvement .  if we are successful on the spreadsheet and not successful with their it  systems , then the other alternative is to build our own reporting system . it  would be similar to a database where the recordsets are replaced by excel  workbooks . it can be constructed in such a way as to enable us to run  simulations and queries , but this would probably take me about five or six  weeks .  finally , don hawkins does operational audits for enron ' s physical assets .  he sends out teams to audit our pipelines and strategic assets . i don ' t  think that he does it for ees , but you might want to give him a call anyway .  - kevin k .  ps : the ees lunch meeting has been moved to wednesdays . jay hachen will  know more .",0

further actions on anjam ' s departure,"hi mel  further to our earlier discussions here ' s the full list of actions we ' d like  to put into place regarding anjam ' s departure :  hr - type stuff :  1 . get anjam off the trading floor as soon as possible . there is no need for  him to remain on the floor . this will need to be delayed until it number 1  is completed ( cataloguing his work ) .  2 . determine where anjam is heading . we need to know who is going to know  our positions and curves next .  3 . remove his security pass , and insist that he is always accompanied when in  the building . sharad is to sit with him while he catalogues his work .  it - type stuff :  1 . ask him to catalogue the contents of his h : drive , since the rest of the  group will need to support his work in the future . this should take no more  than a day or two .  2 . get it to obtain their backups of anjam ' s h : drive for weekly intervals  over the last two months . this will allow us to determine what he has  deleted .  3 . get it to provide a snapshot of anjam ' s notes folders , and provide records  of mail sent out to the internet over the last couple of months . i ' m worried  about code / data he may have zipped up and mailed out .  4 . ask it to use a utility program to determine what has been deleted from  anjam ' s c : drives . there may be useful info here too .  5 . revoke all internet access , whether via explorer or notes mail .  6 . get a record of all files he has printed over the last couple of months .  vince has ok ' d this lot , so let ' s do it asap .  many thanks ,  steve",0

a cry for help,"dear friend , i am mrs . sese - seko widow of late president mobutu  sese - seko of zaire ? now known as democratic republic  of congo ( drc ) . i am moved to write you this letter ,  this was in confidence considering my and situation .  i escaped along with my husband and two of our sons  george kongolo and basher out of democratic republic of  congo ( drc ) to abidjan , cote d ' ivoire where my family  and i settled , while we later moved to settled in  morroco where my husband later died of cancer  disease . however due to this situation we decided to  changed most of my husband ' s billions of dollars  deposited in swiss bank and other countries into other  forms of money coded for safe purpose because the new  head of state of ( dr ) mr laurent kabila has made  arrangement with the swiss government and other  european countries to freeze all my late husband ' s  treasures deposited in some european countries . hence  my children and i decided laying low in africa to  study the situation till when things gets better ,  like now that president kabila is dead and the son  taking over ( joseph kabila ) . one of my late husband ' s  chateaux in southern france was confiscated by the  french government , and as such i had to change my  identity so that my investment will not be traced and  confiscated . i have deposited the sum eighteen million  united state dollars ( us $ 18 , 000 , 000 , 00 . ) with a  security company , for safekeeping . the funds are  security coded to prevent them from  knowing the content . what i want you to do is to  indicate your interest that you will assist us by receiving the money on our  behalf . acknowledge this message , so that i can introduce you to my son  ( kongolo ) who has the out modalities for the claim of the said funds . i  want you to assist in investing this money , but i will not want my identity  revealed . i will also want to buy properties and stock in multi - national  companies and to engage in other safe and  non - speculative investments . may i at this point  emphasise the high level of confidentiality , which  this business demands , and hope you will not betray  the trust and confidence , which i repose in you . in  conclusion , if you want to assist us , my son shall  put you in the picture of the business , tell you  where the funds are currently being maintained and  also discuss other modalities including remunerationfor your services .  for this reason kindly furnish us your contact  information , that is your personal telephone and fax  number for confidential purpose . best regards , mrs m . sese seko",1

re : research sign off,"steve ,  sign - off from the research group is something that requires defining formal  rules going forward .  my concern over the last few years was that we were asked on many occasions  to sign - off on partial results of valuation , without the benefits of a full  picture .  sometimes , we were asked to sign - off on trade ideas , over which we have no  control long - term .  i shall talk to rick buy and david port about setting up more formal rules  for the research sign - off .  vince  steven leppard  01 / 24 / 2001 03 : 42 am  to : sharad agnihotri / lon / ect @ ect  cc : tani nath / lon / ect @ ect , ted murphy / lon / ect @ ect , james new / lon / ect @ ect ,  vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  subject : research sign off  hi sharad  i note from our discussion earlier this morning that you ' ve been asked to  sign off a calculation from another group , which is something we ' re asked to  do from time to time .  i take the view that we in research can assess a computation in terms of what  it achieves with respect to its requirements , what its shortfalls are , and  therefore what the risks associated with using this method are . we cannot  provide an opinion on whether these risks are acceptable to enron , which i  feel falls firmly within rac territory .  this then raises the question of can research sign off anything for other  groups after all ? to "" sign off "" means to accept something , which our opinion  in itself cannot do . it is most appropriate for us to provide a technical  note outlining the methodology , risks and shortcomings of a method , leaving  the formal "" sign off "" to those best placed to assess these risks for our  company . the alternative is for multiple groups each to have their own view  on what is acceptable risk for the company .  steve",0

"" the government , way back in 1995 , has  modified the sales tax rate to 4 per cent to discourage the import of naphtha  from gujarat by electrical companies operating in maharashtra . the decision  was taken with a view to encouraging electrical companies to procure naphtha  at reduced rates within the state , "" government sources added . sources said  that these companies had to pay nearly 15 . 3 per cent sales tax on naphtha  that was procured from gujarat . however , following their representation , the  government slashed the sales tax rate to 4 per cent .  the state finance department ' s opinion , which would be presented before the  state cabinet shortly in order to take a final decision , deserves special  significance especially when the state energy department and the loss - making  maharashtra state electricity board ( mseb ) have wholeheartedly supported the  dpc ' s cause and recommended the sales tax waiver . dpc , which was asked by the  union ministry of oil and petroleum to procure naphtha within the country in  view of excess availability , in its presentation to the state government and  to mseb , had made it clear that it would be left with no alternative but to  pass on the additional burden on the mseb which would be ultimately passed on  to its consumers . dpc had also told the state government that it had not paid  sales tax on the procurement of naphtha from glencore in the calender year  2000 .  sources from the state energy department and mseb have stressed on the need  for such a waiver while expressing their inability to bear additional burden .  they have suggested that the state should reciprocate by offering a sales tax  exemption to dpc because the ioc , at the behest of the centre , has tried to  match the international landing price of naphtha during the recently signed  memorandum of agreement with dpc . "" if the state finance department sticks to  its views , it may hurt the state as a whole , "" sources from the state energy  department and mseb said . dpc will procure naphtha at rs 11 , 050 per ton from  ioc during the calender year 2001 as compared to the rs 10 , 050 per tonne  price quoted by glencore . the naphtha price comprises $ 175 per tonne free on  board ( fob ) , 21 . 8 per cent of customs duty , 5 . 4 per cent of sales tax and  $ 18 . 87 of premium .  dpc senior vice president mukesh tyagi reiterated that the company has  already made an appeal to the state government for the sales tax waiver on  naphtha in the larger interest of the consumers . "" sales tax is a pass through  and mseb , which will have to bear the additional burden , will pass it on the  consumers , "" he added .  - - - - - - -  centre yet to receive proposal on enron  thursday jan 18 2001  centre on wednesday said that it had not recevied any proposal from  maharashtra government seeking help to solve the tangle with the enron  promoted dhabol power project relating to cost and surplus power . asked about  the reports that maharashtra government was sending a proposal that centre  buy surplus power from dhabol power company through power trading  corporation , power minister suresh prabhu said "" we have not received any  proposal . "" "" we are carefully watching the situation and will await a concrete  proposal before intervening in this matter , "" parbhu said on the sidelines of  greentech environment excellence awards ceremony , here . asked whether there  was any possibility of the government asking the power trading corporation to  buy power from the dhabol power corporation , prabhu replied "" what will the  ptc do with the power ? ""  prabhu had earlier asked the state government to study the matter before  approaching the centre for payment of dues . mseb had earlier declined to pick  up its 15 per cent stake in phase ii of the 1444 mw project . the enron issue  has been hanging fire with the maharashtra state electricity board unable to  clear the dues of dpc as a result of the skyrocketing prices of naphtha  infact mseb has asked dpc to backdown completely leading to a situation where  dpc has stopped production at the facility from the begining of the  month . state government has stepped in with support to the tune of rs 114  crore to enable mseb to clear the dues for october . mseb dues to dpc for  november and december amount to over rs 300 crores .",0

re : gwen koepke,"anne ,  thanks for contacting me about this .  as a matter of fact , i wanted to talk to you about it  today as this matter was outstanding for a long time .  i think we should go ahead and adjust gwen to manager ,  effective march 1 . the compensation would be her current base plus  10 k . this is what we typically do when we promote an associate to a manager .  such promotions take place in march and i think  gwen should not be penalized for the inefficiency of her management  ( i . e . my and maureen ' s procrastination ) .  on unrelated and more serious matter . gary hickerson is the primary client  for maureen ' s services . he communicated to me a few weeks ago that he is  unwilling to underwrite maureen ' s position ( he is in general unhappy with  her contribution ) . this means that maureen will have to find another sponsor  or leave enron .  given her abrasive and aggressive personality finding another internal  customer  will be quite a challenge .  gary volunteered to pay a very generous severance to maureen from his budget .  i would like to talk to you about it when you have a few minutes .  vince  from : anne labbe / enron @ enronxgate on 05 / 02 / 2001 10 : 34 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : gwen koepke  vince ,  just wanted to touch base with you . i have tried to contact maureen so that  gwen ' s title and salary can be adjusted to manager just as you requested , but  have not heard any response from her . would you like for me to wait until i  hear from maureen or should i go ahead and proceed in changing her title ? i  just want to make sure that gwen is in the right peer group during prc .  also , i am going to try and set up a meeting with you next week through  shirley to discuss any buring issues that you are experiencing , and your  expectations during prc .  thanks ,  anne",0

discount rates and risk capital,"dear vince :  i spent a little bit longer putting together my initial thoughts on  determining discount rates than i originally anticipated . it is somewhat  surprising , but there really isn ' t much academic work that i am aware of  that addresses these issues .  very briefly ,  1 . i think we need to come up with a way to define the concept of risk  capital simultaneously with the appropriate discount rate .  2 . i think it is important to model enron ' s opportunity cost of capital and  how that changes over time . the liquidity of a project will affect its  value in a very significant way when the opportunity cost of capital  changes over time . there is also likely to be a relation between duration  and discount rates that depends on the factors generating enron ' s  opportunity cost of capital .  3 . i have vague ideas about possible simulations that may help us quantify  some of the issues that i have raised .  please take a look at the attached document . you might find this somewhat  confusing , so i will give you a call later in the week to discuss this .  please let me know when you will be free . i look forward to hearing from you .  regards ,  sheridan  - determining discount rates for risky projects . doc  sheridan titman  department of finance  college of business administration  university of texas  austin , texas 78712 - 1179  512 - 232 - 2787 ( phone )  512 - 471 - 5073 ( fax )  titman @ mail . utexas . edu",0

"resume of phil roan , koch weather desk","shirley ,  phil roan , the quantitative analyst from koch ' s weather derivatives group  will be here on the afternoon of friday june 16 , beginning say , at 1 : 30 or  2 : 00 . vince asked me to ask you to put a set of interviews together ( as i  understand , vince himself will be unavailable that day ) .  mark tawney should see him ; someone from weather marketing and / or  structuring should see him , e . g . gary taylor and / or michael nguyen ; some more  people from research should grill him on technical and meteorology issues ,  e . g . vasant and / or zimin as well as mike roberts or someone on his team . phil  has only been a "" quant "" since the departure of koch ' s previous weather quant  in february ; before that he was koch ' s weather "" risk manager "" . i am still not  sure what the distinction means , but we do need to find out how much he knows  about option pricing and meteorology . even though his expressed desire is to  focus on weather derivatives , we should also assess how useful he would be  from research group ' s perspective , since research will likely be his official  home .  finally , jere overdyke and / or someone else from his group ( george carrick ,  if available ) should also get a chance to meet with him . i ' ve already spoken  with phil , but i ' d like to sit in with either vasant or zimin or mike when  they interview him , since i wasn ' t able to ask any technical questions .  if i ' m counting correctly , that should amount to five interview sessions ,  perhaps less if we interview in groups of two . phil ' s resume is enclosed  below .  joe  p . s . i will also forward this to jason sokolov . he will let you know if any  people from rac would also like to meet with him .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by joseph hrgovcic / hou / ect on 06 / 07 / 2000  08 : 40 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect , joseph  hrgovcic / hou / ect @ ect , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : resume of phil roan , koch weather desk  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by jason sokolov / hou / ect on 06 / 05 / 2000 01 : 54  pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  "" roan , philip "" on 06 / 05 / 2000 08 : 33 : 00 am  to : "" jason sokolov ( e - mail ) ""  cc :  subject :  jason ,  here ' s the attachment we discussed . i ' ll call you this afternoon .  phil roan  roanp @ kochind . com  ( 713 ) 544 - 7469  > - - - - - original message - - - - -  > from : proan @ mindspring . com [ smtp : proan @ mindspring . com ]  > sent : sunday , june 04 , 2000 8 : 07 pm  > to : pr @ work  > subject :  >  > >  - philip f roan . doc",0

iraq and crude output,an interesting piece of information from the oil markets .  iraq is trying to extract concessions from the us and threatens to shut down  production as of oct 1 ( just in time for the us elections ) .  the source of this info is phil verlaeger ( an oil analyst ) .  he is very good but excessively concerned with iraqi machinations .  he is the source of news ( reported by friedman of the new york times in  his op - ed columns ) about massive iraqi trading in the  oil futures markets . i personally discount this info : the volume and  transparency of  the oil markets would not support this type of huge scale operations by  saddam ' s  government . there may be some trading by iraqi officials on the side .  vince,0

color copier,"thanks for your immediate response .  the problem seems to be the cost .  iain , i have the smallest group but we are  willing to pay what it takes for the copier .  on the other hand there may be other groups  that are larger and may not need the copier  as much and are not willing to pay the cost .  seems to me , the copier is a necessity for the floor ,  it would save not only time , but money also  in the long haul .  we have updated every possibility on the  32 nd floor and this copier is needed for quick  presentations , meetings , etc . and allows everyone  not to depend on color printers as much !

re : houston trip,"dear vince / christie ,  thanks for coming to philadelphia to present an overview of the projects . we  enjoyed meeting you and your colleagues and look forward to working with  enron . i would also like to pass on my team ' s appreciation for the dinner as  well .  we wanted to give you an update on our project and get some feedback and  additional information prior to our upcoming visit to houston on january  19 th . our project is going to be geared to the 3 rd option you mentioned . we  plan on addressing some part of the retail energy services business . we are  considering two options regarding this topic and would like to pursue either  ( i ) how customers are acquired and recommending new processes and ways to  serve retail customers , or  ( ii ) studying the supply chain and coming up with recommendations for areas  for further investments .  however , we would like to get some more information on the retail energy  services before truly scoping the project . we are also very open to  suggestions , especially if you had a much broader or different scope in mind ;  so please let us know .  we have not yet reviewed the introductory information received last week , but  here are the questions we have specific to the retail energy services unit :  can we look at its overall business plan or a more detailed summary than is  in the annual report ?  what is the pricing philosophy / overall structure ?  who are the customers and how are they acquired ?  what would the customers be doing if they did not work with enron ?  what are the international expansion plans and capabilities ?  is there any important regulatory summary information we can have ?  if this information is not already covered in the review material you sent ,  will you be able recommend other sources where we may find such information ?  after we have reviewed the material sent to us recently , we may want to  schedule a phone call with you and / or one of your colleagues directly  involved in the retail energy services business . i would like to call you in  the new year to discuss this further . in the meantime , please feel free to  call me at ( 215 ) 546 - 9416 if you need any information .  regards ,  retail energy services tiger team  ram  dennis  jason  omar  steve  clay",0

re : estimating tail of distribution and additional risk measures,"naveen ,  the "" analytical var "" approach is working for equity portfolio .  it gives us the tool to examine the tails ' behavior for this portfolio and  calculate "" expected tail loss "" .  the same should be done for commodities portfolio as well .  meanwhile , as we discussed , we can give some rough estimates of the losses  corresponding to percentiles other than 5 th .  look at the figure below . you can see var numbers for 5 % , 1 % , 0 . 5 % and 0 . 1 %  calculated with  1 ) simulations ( 100 thousand simulations ) ;  2 ) analytical var ( gamma - delta positions representation )  1 ) and 2 ) are very close because there are not many options in equity  portfolio .  3 ) simulations ( 1000 simulations ) to calculate 5 % var . then in order to  approximately estimate var for 1 % , 0 . 5 % and 0 . 1 %  i scaled 5 % var with factors corresponding to normal distribution ( for  example : norminv ( 0 . 001 , 0 , 1 ) / norminv ( 0 . 05 , 0 , 1 ) for 0 . 1 % ) .  the result of such extrapolation in this case is quite good ( just 5 %  different from the correct number ) .  we probably can use such rough estimates of tail for commodities portfolio  until we have proper methods implemented .  tanya tamarchenko  02 / 28 / 2001 01 : 17 pm  to : wenyao jia / hou / ect , debbie r brackett / hou / ect @ ect  cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  subject : re : "" analytical "" var implementation in risktrac  debbie ,  i am forwarding to you a 2 page document describing implementation of  "" analytical "" var in risktrac .  here is why this effort is very important :  1 . we need to calculate var for other percentile but 5 ( 1 % or even 0 . 2 % as  mentioned by rick buy )  and our simulation model can not handle required number of simulations ;  2 . we need to present additional risk measures ( such as mean tail loss ) to  the board .  the analytical approach is implemented in a spreadsheet and fully tested  already so there will be no problems  with the algorithm itself .  we need to get together and discuss it implementation .  what do you think ?  tanya",0

ljm,"vince / stinson :  the following is an update on ljm deal :  1 ) i participated on a conference call with aa ( jitendra and others ) and our  accounting / credit group ( wes , bill bradford and others ) yesturday , in which  we discussed the best approach for definining credit reserves at year - end for  the puts we own .  2 ) a big chunck of the meeting was dedicated to explain aa the details of the  deal . little progress was made on achieving the meeting ' s goal .  3 ) apparently , accounting did want to expose the calculation we made for puts  value that considers credit risk - the two factor model we developed . that  line of action was implied on a pre - meeting we had early that morning . from  my understanding , accounting argues that we should not make any credit  reserve because we could not liquidate our position by year - end .  4 ) at a certain point jintendra suggested me to use a two factor  mc - simulation for calculating the position with credit risk . the approach is  actually a more simplified version of the model we have . i and nobody  mentioned the results we got from our 2 - factor model .  5 ) at that same afternoon i knew from accounting that we are in a process of  unwinding our position .  these are the main points . please let me know if need more details .  paulo issler",0

market maker simulation v . 2,"stinson and vince ,  i finished the second version of the model which deals with open to close  trading .  the major difference is that there is an additional mark to market at open  price which  will affect the p / l .  i also added the output features that john wants to see .  the cumulative p / l is path dependent , the net open allowed seemingly has  a strong influence on the cumulative p / l trajectory . ( the anomaly i  discussed  with vince is due to the trajectory shape change which needs further  examination ) .  could you review what i have done before we talk to john again ?  zimin",0

term contracts with power generators . under the  bill , the state of california would control 10 % of all california ' s  electricity . as you  can imagine , this legislation has not received unanimous praise . according  to recent corporate filings , pg & e ' s hydroelectric plants alone would be  valued  between $ 3 and $ 5 billion . this amount just happens to be what davis  estimates to be the final amount of money the state will have to guarantee  once  the audit of the utility companies is released and the political pressure is  escalated on the parent companies to absorb some of the $ 12 billion in debt .  davis  is telling people that he thinks the audit will show the state should help  with about $ 4 billion in debt , while the utilities , of course , say the full  $ 12 billion should  be covered .  on wednesday , state officials will see the results of sealed bids from energy  suppliers for long term contracts and see how close to reality their  effort to keep utility rates unchanged for consumers will come . davis  insists there are already several bids for his 5 . 5 cents per kilowatt hour  ceiling , though few  agree with his opinion . a handful of smaller , independent electricity  providers with about a 30 % share of california power market , indicated sunday  night they would come down to "" less than eight cents "" or less than half of  what they currently charge , in return for the stability of long term  contracts . because  consumers pay about 6 . 5 cents per kilowatt hour for electricity under current  puc rules , any hope california has to "" work off "" the back debts for these  utilities lies  in hitting something very close to davis ' price cap , without falling back on  higher prices for consumers . the level of bids will be particularly  important since bond  rating agencies moved to put the state of california on a credit watch on  friday , worried that there was no obvious long - term repayment plan for the  billions of  dollars they are on the hook for spending to keep the lights on in the state .  utility ' s audit  by the middle of this week , california auditors will release their findings  about how much money pg & e and socal edison actually owe to institutions  outside their own holding company structure . this will define the limits of  what the state will guarantee , if they guarantee any of the debt . the truly  explosive  part of the audit may be its findings that the two companies used billions of  dollars from consumers to buy back their own stock in recent years . a  source with  knowledge of the audits said the audit is expected to show that in the last  three years , pg & e ' s utility subsidiary handed over about $ 5 billion to the  holding  company . of that total , the holding company used $ 4 . 4 billion to pay  shareholder dividends and buyback shares of its stock .  another finding from the audit shows that state helped caused the current  power crisis when regulators , at the time of deregulation ( under the  direction of  former r - gov . pete wilson ) , forced the two utilities to sell at least half of  their power - generating plants . auditors are expected to say that if the  utilities  still owned all these plants , electricity would cost only 7 cents a kilowatt  hour , compared with over 30 cents an hour on average in december and january .  bankruptcy  the threat of bankruptcy is still very real for both utilities . senior  advisors said that these utilities were on the path often followed by utility  companies that  ended in bankruptcy . as all the parties involved hunker down for another  intensely political week , they all remain determined to avoid bankruptcy , but  to push  this as close to the brink as possible in the hopes of squeezing out an  advantage . under such conditions , the risks of one or more of the players  fumbling and  triggering the great unknowable outcome of bankruptcy , is still quite high .  california ' s political leaders order a series of independent analyses to  determine who would suffer most in a case of bankruptcy , the state or the two  utilities .  the short answer was that no one has any idea . below are the findings of the  report and some of the possible scenarios that would face a bankruptcy judge :  1 ) would the companies be eligible for chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy ?  some of the advisors thought that pg & e and edison ' s finances were so  bad that chapter 11 style temporary bankruptcy may not even be an option .  advisors said that a bankruptcy judge might take a good look at the corporate  debt load and decide that reorganization would do no good and order the  companies into full liquidation . this would most certainly be guaranteed  chaos .  2 ) could the bankruptcy court actually force the puc to raise the price of  electricity to consumers ? the legal basis for passing on rate increases to  consumers is a lot less solid than originally thought , particularly if there  is widespread public outrage directed at the electricity companies . and  there is still the  question of the unilateral power of a bankruptcy judge .  3 ) if the bankruptcy judge takes his job of protecting corporate assets  seriously and finds that pg & e and edison cannot afford to buy electricity ,  he could order them to stop buying it and thus lead to massive power outages .  4 ) if the utilities go into bankruptcy , the first creditors in line would be  the lenders and bondholders with collateral pledges . the state could become  almost the last creditor in line as it is just another electricity supplier  ( one of the reasons why suppliers won ' t sell electricity on credit to these  companies now ) .  5 ) if the two companies went bankrupt , it would be the largest bankruptcies  in history , straining just about everyone involved in the process .  6 ) the corporate approval allowing the parent company to segregate assets  from the utility by the ferc for pg & e and already in place for edison  may be far less effective than the utilities or the ratings agencies  currently think . this is particularly true if this week ' s audit shows the two  corporations transferring  billions of dollars in the last few years into stock buybacks and shareholder  dividend payments .  davis  opinion polls show that governor gray davis is getting high marks for his  job , and the utilities are increasingly viewed as the culprits . one of davis  concern ' s is , according to a senior official in the governor ' s office , that a  deal is carved out that triggers a popular ballot initiative which is so  anti - utility and  anti - business that it cripples future growth in the state . according to a  senior official , "" no one thought howard jarvis and his property tax  initiative would  succeed in destroying our education system , but he did , with one just ballot  line and a lot of popular revulsion . the threat of direct , popular action  is at least as large now as then . "" consumer advocate harvey rosenfield is  already threatening to draw up a ballot initiative at the first sign that  individual  electricity consumers are being asked to help the utility companies repay  their debt through higher rate - payer bills . this official goes on to say ,  "" the  anger at utility companies is so high here , that almost anything rosenfield  could think of would pass and we couldn ' t do anything about it . "" this threat  has  begun to complicate the one escape route on the debt front that had always  appeared wide open to political leaders - - floating a bond issue or a  guarantee  for the money owed to institutions outside the corporate holding structure ,  and then letting the companies work that off with profits over the next  several years .",0

energy book,"hi grant ,  hope all is well with you . i trust you got my message via the voicemail  that ileft with vince late friday afternoon about my inability to travel -  i ' m trying to rearrange my trip for a couple of week ' s time when my ear has  cleared up , and i look forward to meeting with you one day .  i wrote to vince last week asking for a favour , but i ' m not sure ifhe is  there in houston . i know that you guys are probably very busy but i was  wondering if you can write a few sentences for me . i ' m sending out some  sample chapters to the people who responded positively ( all of them ! ) to my  request for some feedback on the book . chapter 1 has an ' overview ' of the  book with just a couple of sentences on each chapter . could you please  write a sentence or two for your chapter ?  i ' m including what i have already written ( although i think it has changed  slightly from this version ) so that you can see the style .  many thanks and best regards .  chris .  2 overview of this book  this book aims to provide an in - depth understanding of the pricing and risk  management of energy derivatives . in the remainder of this chapter we give  an overview of the fundamental principals needed to model and price energy  assets , and which underlie the rest of the book . as well as introducing  the techniques that underlie the black - scholes modelling framework we  discuss the numerical techniques of trinomial trees and monte carlo  simulation for derivative pricing which are used extensively later in the  book .  in chapter 2 we analyse spot energy prices . apart from describing  empirical prices we propose a number of processes that can be used to model  the prices . we look at the well - know process of gbm as well as mean  reversion , stochastic volatility and jump processes , discussing each , and  showing how they can be simulated and their parameters estimated .  chapter 3 , written by vince kaminski and grant masson of enron capital and  trade .  chapter 4 examines forward curves in the energy markets . although such  curves are well understood and straight forward in the world debt markets  the difficulty of storage in many energy markets leads to less well defined  curves . what we do in this chapter  chapter 5 presents an overview of the common and not - so - common derivative  structures in the energy markets and discusses their uses . examples of  products analysed in this chapter include a variety of swaps , caps , floors  and collars , as well as energy swaptions , compound options , asian ( or  average rate ) options , barriers , lookbacks , and ladder options .  chapter 6 investigates single and multi - factor models of the energy spot  price and the pricing of some standard energy derivatives . closed form  solutions for forward prices , forward volatilities , and european option  prices are derived and presented for all the models in this chapter  including a three factor stochastic convenience yield and interest rate  model with jumps .  chapter 7 shows how the prices of path dependent and american style options  can be evaluated for the models in chapter 6 . simulation schemes are  developed for the evaluation of european style options and applied to a  variety of path dependent options . in order to price options which  incorporate early exercise opportunities , a trinomial tree scheme is  developed . this tree is built to be consistent with the observed forward  curve and can be used to price exotic as well as standard american style  options .  chapter 8 develops a new methodology for valuing energy options based on  modelling the market observed forward curve . the approach results in a  multi - factor model that is able to capture realistically the evolution of a  wide range of energy forward curves and where the user defined volatility  structures can be of an extremely general form . closed - form solutions are  developed for pricing standard european options and efficient monte carlo  schemes for exotic options . the chapter finishes with a discussion of the  valuation of american style options .  chapter 9 focuses on the risk management of energy derivative positions .  in this chapter we discuss the management of price risk for institutions  that sell options or other derivatives to a client and who is then faced  with the problem of managing the risk through time . we begin with delta  hedging a portfolio containing derivatives and look at extensions to gamma  hedging - using the models from chapters 5 and 7 . the general model of  chapter 7 ideally suited to multi - factor hedging and this is also  discussed .  chapter 10 looks at the key risk - management concept of value at risk  applied to portfolios containing energy derivative portfolios . after  discussing the concept of the measure , we look at how the key inputs  ( volatilities , covariances , correlations , etc ) can be estimated . we then  compare the fours major methodologies for computing var ; delta ,  delta - gamma , historical simulation and monte - carlo simulation . finally , we  look at testing the var estimates for various underlying energy market  variables .",0

short term private firm model : static historical,"snapshot + performance data for model development  mike , scott , eric ,  after brainstorming and discussing further on data here , we think that our final specifications for modelling data requirement need to be as follows :  we need bankrupt , default and nondefault ( which covers nonbankrupt ) accounts with 4 quarterly observation snapshots and 12 months performance following the latest snapshot . monthly performance indicator need to be available for the entire 12 months performance period . we will need all the bankrupt and default accounts and comparable sample of good accounts with weights .  for the purpose of model validation , we will need data with above specs covering 16 months of performance . this means that we will need rolling ( 4 quarterly snapshots + 12 months performance ) data for 4 monthly shifts :  input snapshots performance  1999 march end , 1999 june end , 1999 september end , 1999 december end 12 month end performance for jan 2000 through dec 2000  1999 feb end , 1999 may end , 1999 august end , 1999 november end 12 month end performance for dec 1999 through nov 2000  1999 jan end , 1999 apr end , 1999 july end , 1999 october end 12 month end performance for nov 1999 through oct 2000  1998 december end , 1999 mar end , 1999 june end , 1999 september end 12 month end performance for oct 1999 through sep 2000  we will need bankruptcy chapterwise indicator , if available during the performance period . our definition of default is either bankruptcy or 90 + days delinquency on any trade credit .  we have also discussed the cost aspect and we think considering the big picture , it makes sense to spend the extra amount to get the right data for analysis .  please let me know your thoughts . this will require d & b to give us a modified quote and we could possibly move forward quickly .  regards ,  amitava",0

class speaker,"vincent ,  we met last year when you were visiting the university , and talking  primarily with our finance faculty . as you may have heard , i tried to call  to talk with you about the possiblity of a guest speaker in my class on real  options from your group at enron . naturally , i would be delighted if you  could speak , but i could also appreciate the possibility that someone else  might also be a good choice .  i have attached a copy of the course syllabus for your information .  this is the first time this course has been offered at ut , and i was  motivated to do so because of the "" buzz "" regarding the topic in industry . i  have about 30 mba students in the class , many of whom were in the energy  finance classes offered by sheridan titman and ehud ronn ( both of whom have  been very supportive of the development of this class ) . my own background  is decision analysis rather than finance , so i tend to approach the topic  with that perspective . as you can see , i have covered both traditional  decison analysis topics and a review of the options literature . at the  present time , i don ' t think there is a really complete textbook that fits  the course at the mba level , so i ' ve tried to focus on how to do things in  practice , and have provided software ( dpl , spreadsheets , @ risk , etc ) as  tools for the students to use .  the course is scheduled on thursday afternoons from 3 : 30 to 6 : 30 ,  which is a time that i chose to make possible the participation of some  executive mba students from houston ( 3 are participating ) . i look forward  to hearing from you about the possiblity of a speaker , or any other  suggestions that you might have .  james s . dyer  fondren centennial chair in business  department of management science and information systems  cba 5 . 202  the university of texas at austin  austin , texas 78712 - 1175  email : j . dyer @ bus . utexas . edu  telephone : 512 - 471 - 5278  fax : 512 - 471 - 0587",0

re : seeking opportunity in computational finance,"dear vince :  thanks for your response .  i am not a programmer , nor a "" quant "" . i am an expert in excel and otherwise  have advanced skills in the remaining msoffice suite . beyond that i have  extensive experience working with research and computer progamming personnel  on projects from networks to databases , and in particular , automation .  for instance , the first generation of the risk analytics system that i  designed for quantlab was done in excel . in subsequent generations of the  system , excel served only as the gui - given its extreme flexibility - and a  sql database operated underneath ( compaq servers , raid array ) , integrating  real - time operations for all components of the system .  the research team at quantlab used many leading edge modelling  methodologies , such as genetic algorithms , neural networks , principal  component analysis , kernel density estimation , fast kernel regression ,  hidden markov modelling and many other pattern recognition , walk - forward  back testing , and other simulation techniques .  i was the sole individual on a team of 17 that had any practical trading  experience , and therefore , felt that i played a critical role in the  application and implementation of each of the system components from data  mining to research to signal generation to execution . beyond that , i was  uniquely qualified to articulate the project ' s mission to investors , and  therefore , was highly successful in spearheading support - financial and  otherwise - from our network .  althought i did not ask specifically , i surmise from your question that you  are leading a research effort . i believe that my skill set is best served  as a liaison between research and trading , since i speak both languages . i  believe that i possess great vision and enthusiasim that could be leveraged  in a group , project or product management role to integrate and streamline  diverse systems and processes ; a common scenario in most proprietary  development settings today .  in closing , i would like to learn more about enron and the financial  technology effort therein through further discussion with you , or if that is  not appropriate , someone to whom you would be comfortable referring me .  i look forward to your thoughts .  best regards ,  paul  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : vince . j . kaminski @ enron . com [ mailto : vince . j . kaminski @ enron . com ]  sent : tuesday , november 14 , 2000 4 : 30 pm  to : epr @ pipeline . com  subject : re : seeking opportunity in computational finance  paul ,  can you give me more information about your computer skills ?  my group is very hands - on oriented and computer programming is a critical  skill .  vince  "" paul rowady "" on 11 / 14 / 2000 04 : 09 : 43 pm  to : "" vince kaminski ""  cc :  subject : seeking opportunity in computational finance  dear vince :  in following up on my voicemail message today , i attach my resume below for  your review and consideration .  it ' s ironic that you called while i was putting the message together . i  will keep it short and look forward to speaking to you at your convenience .  best regards ,  paul  e . paul rowady , jr .  2300 west alabama , suite 69  houston , texas 77098  713 - 807 - 8624 home / fax  713 - 539 - 4541 mobile  epr @ pipeline . com  ( see attached file : paul rowady 2 . doc )",0

eol wti historical trade simulation - more profitable trading,"strategy  please ignor my previous mail regarding the same issue , which contains some  typos .  greg and john ,  i found that by reducing the volume per trade and increasing daily number of  trades ( keeping the  total volume per day constant ) , we can be more profitable . this is partially  because in a trending market  we lose less money by following the market more closely . for example , suppose  market move from  $ 30 to $ 35 . if per trade volume is 10 , 000 bbl and the half bid - offer spread  is $ 1 for simplicity , we take 5  trades of short positions , the total mtm for that day is  ( - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 ) * 10 , 000 = - $ 150 , 000 and total trading  volume is 50 , 000 bbl short . if per trade volume is 50 , 000 bbl , we take one  trade , the total mtm is  - 5 * 50 , 000 = - $ 250 , 000 . thus the net difference between the two trading  strategies is $ 10 , 000 for that  particular day .  therefore it seems that by reducing per trade volume and increasing the  number of trades , we can be more  profitable as a market maker .  i rerun a scenario that stinson sent to you on dec . 27 where he used per  trade volume of 30 , 000 bbl .  i reduce the number of trade to 10 , 000 while increasing the number of trades  by factor of 3 . almost in all  cases , i saw increased profitability . see the colume marked "" change "" for  dollar amount change in millions .  please let stinson or me know your thoughts on this .  regards ,  zimin lu  x 36388  as compared to",0
gas prices,"vince -  1 . we can detect "" hoarding "" of pipeline capacity as an elevated basis against  the actual inflow .  2 . we can detect "" market power "" by dissociating the seller from the buyer ,  distinguishing between the physical "" cost "" in gas to run the generators and  the transmission cost in dollars , i . e . the basis .  3 . ( as you noted ) we can detect "" storage "" as the difference between inflow  and consumption .  it appears to me there are two time series needed for a straightforward model  of gas prices : flow rates at interconnects ( from telemetry ) and spot - market  prices . there is an elevated basis reflecting pipeline companies monopolizing  capacity , as well as hoarding of capacity by contracts . the dynamics of gas  prices reflect consumption demand changes due to changes in expectations for  the weather , as well as their impact on two highly strategic behaviors :  hoarding of pipeline capacity and storage of gas . we can "" calibrate "" the  price elasticity of demands for consumption and storage , and the price  elasticities of demand for transmission , as well as the extent of hoarding ,  from the two sets of numbers mentioned : flows and prices . what the basis  trader needs to understand are the incentives , and disincentives , for storage  and capacity - hoarding , in terms of the calibrated price - elasticities , and  each of these are as - if exotic call options at the consumption hub . finally ,  flows are "" explained "" by the model , and can be imputed from prices if  necessary , resulting in a purely stochastic model of the basis in terms of  the weather .  i believe the problem is quite tractable , and i would like to proceed with a  model .  clayton",0

california update 1 / 31 / 01,"please do not hesitate to contact robert johnston ( x 39934 ) or kristin walsh  ( x 39510 ) with additional questions .  executive summary  an announcement could be made as early as today regarding the first wave of  long - term contracts ( price and term ) .  the threat of bankruptcy is significantly diminishing as davis hatches a plan  to 1 ) pass on "" court ordered rate increases "" and 2 ) issue revenue bonds .  audit results are in and questions loom about the amount of funds transferred  to parent companies . davis is expected to use the threat of "" endless  appeals "" in courts and a possible ballot initiative in november to keep the  pressure on the parent companies to pay a share of the utility debt , as well  as to limit the scope of the rate hikes .  davis hopes that a court ruling in favor of the utilities would provide him  with the political cover he needs to pass on rate hikes to california  consumers and avoid utility bankruptcy .  davis walking a fine line with consumer advocacy groups . if there is a  ballot initiative in november to challenge the expected court - ordered rate  hikes , it could be disastrous for investor confidence in the state .  legislation and bail out  bill ablx was heard for several hours in the senate appropriations  yesterday . issues still remain regarding the tiered rate structure ,  specifically for communities that have harsh climates . however , the bill has  received support from almost everyone including consumer groups . the bill  is expected to pass sometime today . tim gage , ca director of finance said  davis supports all the provisions in ablx and expected to sign .  bill abl 8 x was not heard in the assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear  today . in committee hearings monday , the dwr testified it is spent all of  the $ 400 m and were spending $ 45 m / day in the spot market to buy power .  according to sources with direct access to governor davis , the on - going court  battle , as discussed below , is viewed as an excellent opportunity for a  settlement . davis recognizes that 1 ) the expected court ruling in the cpuc  case will likely authorize the utilities to increase rates charged to  california rate payers ; 2 ) despite that ruling , the state government has the  ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the  two utilities unless they come to terms . thus , davis believes that  california consumers cannot avoid getting hit with higher electricity  charges , but he plans to use the threat of an appeal ( and a possible ballot  initiative ) to limit the amount of the rate hikes .  a plan to exempt the lowest income , smallest consumers from any rate increase  and to concentrate rate increases among consumers using 130 % of a baseline  usage rate was gaining serious momentum last night in sacramento . that would  still hit about one half of all consumers ( since the "" baseline "" is set at 60 %  of average consumption ) , but it is "" progressive "" in a politically important  sense .  making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night  when pg & e admitted they had stopped reading electricity meters for many  customers and were estimating their bills based on previous usage rates .  the company ' s defense ( they had laid off meter readers to conserve cash ) was  met with widespread derision as consumer advocates pointed out the estimation  policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious  efforts by californians to use less electricity . "" every time you think  there ' s a moment when these utilities will not embarrass themselves ,  something like this happens , "" one legislator moaned .  long - term contracts  a second key to keeping the eventual rate increases down lies in the  negotiations now almost complete for the first wave of long - term power buying  contracts davis initiated earlier this month . the first wave of those  contracts will be announced perhaps as early as today and they will be  surprisingly positive , according to officials in the talks . "" we got a series  of good offers in those initial proposals . and some not so good ones , "" one  official told our source . "" the idea is to announce the results of the first  contract talks with the good guys and then go back to the others and say ,  ' you want in on this with these terms ? ' we think we ' ll eventually shake  loose a lot of supply with this strategy . ""  bankruptcy  because of these new dynamics , there is improved market confidence that  california will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for  socal edison and pg & e , even as they are set to miss another round of payments  to creditors and suppliers today ( remember , there is a standstill agreement  among creditors not to ask for accelerated payment until feb . 13 ) .  we believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost  by the court case in front of us district judge ronald s . w . lew in los  angeles , which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for  elected officials that make a settlement possible by the end of next week , at  the latest . in fact , without that political cover it would be impossible to  square all the various circles of this crisis .  audit results and ballot initiatives  markets , bush administration officials , and perhaps utility companies  themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizens groups will  launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of 200 l to bring all  electricity generation back under state control . the threat of a proposition  initiative mounted as the two audits of the utility companies ordered by the  california public utilities commission released in the last 48 hours  confirmed two seriously damaging points we have been warning about since  mid - january . first , the audit of socal edison confirmed that $ 2 billion of  the debt the utility claims it owes to energy suppliers is actually owed to  itself through its corporate holding structure that generates and sells  power . second , it confirmed that edison electric paid nearly $ 5 billion in  profits to the holding company which then used that money to buy back its  stock and increase dividends in an effort to keep its stock price up even  while it was going on a debt - issuing binge .  the audit of pg & e released late last night was even more damaging : pg & e  management was sharply criticized for poor decisions in failing to react to  "" clear warning signs of an approaching energy crisis "" by not making deep  spending cuts , "" including scaling back management salaries . "" the auditors  also questioned the utility ' s decision to funnel some $ 4 . 7 billion of its  profits since deregulation into the coffers of its parent holding company ,  which then used the cash mostly to pay dividends and buy back stocks .  "" basically , they took the money and ran , "" as state senate speaker burton put  it yesterday .  what appears to be governor gray davis ' grudging acceptance of reality is  actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough  rate hikes / taxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without  triggering a new - - and far more damaging - - burst of populist outrage among  a voter base that still thinks the utility companies are basically making  this all up . there is no doubt that this use of money by socal edison and  the debts it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the  spirit of the 1996 deregulation law , but that is irrelevant in popular  political terms . were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by  the court case discussed below , these audits would make settlement extremely  difficult .  keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key  to understanding the very complex game that davis , his advisers and senior  legislators are now playing . a ballot initiative would be a potential  disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at re - establishing full  public control over the electric utilities . even if the state and utilities  successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be years before  that victory was clear and it would freeze all new private investment during  that prolonged period . that ' s something california cannot afford as  businesses would be moving out and new ones failing to relocate .  court battle  thus , legislators are listening in horror as they hear the ugly details of  the court case in los angeles that socal edison and pg & e are likely to win in  mid - february . the court will most likely grant the two utilities $ 12 . 7  billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulders  of consumers who would see bills rise by at least 30 % , california politicians  could see the emergence of the one thing everyone has needed since the start  of this extended drama : political cover . davis will then have to rely on his  political and negotiating skills to pressure the parent companies of the  utilities to pass on something less than the full $ 12 . 7 billion debt .  pg & e and socal edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed  to let them raise electricity rates enough to recover all of the debt they  have accumulated since august last year when the puc refused to let them  raise prices even as electricity prices soared . the court said the 1996  deregulation law was crystal clear - - when the two utilities had repaid  so - called "" stranded costs , "" they were free to begin charging whatever they  needed to charge consumers to cover their cost of acquiring power .  although the utilities won this case , the judge stayed his order until  february 14 th at the state government ' s request . as that deadline  approaches , an intense new negotiating round is under way . on the one hand ,  political officials know they have the ultimate political cover for higher  electric prices ( "" the courts made me do it "" ) , but on the other hand , they  also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would  force electricity rates up by about 40 % on top of natural gas bills that have  soared by about 300 % since last year . utility companies are playing this  card aggressively in negotiations about the scope and shape of the final  bailout . "" we ' ll just wait until the court puts the order into effect in  mid - february then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and  easily . ""  one tactic the state political officials are using , in order to force a  settlement , is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the  next couple of years . one political official pointed out that they could  keep the utilities from receiving their money this year , next year or perhaps  even the year after . "" sure , we tell them , they will probably win in court and  get that money . eventually . we are making them well aware that unless we  have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the supreme  court and keep them tied up for the next two years at least . we don ' t think  the creditors will be quite that patient .

credit support value for mg and paperco,"find below a spreadsheet with my very rough calculation of the value of  credit support for mg and paperco .  my approach is as follows :  1 . assume all contracts can be modelled as financial swaps .  2 . spread the notional trading volumes over the estimated swap tenors .  3 . calculate the value of defaulting at each period of the swap ( the  default option ) using black ' s formula .  4 . treat the value of the default options as risky cash flows . that is  treat this value just like you would an annuity stream . by discounting back  this stream of cash flows at the original risky rate and at the risk - reduced  rate , i find the value of credit enhancement as the difference in the two  npv ' s .  please give your comments , especially if this makes no sense to you .  stinson",0

"" the 326 companies  we surveyed are planning on an 18 . 2 percent increase , versus a 10 . 2 percent  rise budgeted in december , "" said james d .  crandell , who follows oil services and drilling for the new york investment  banker .  he emphasized that the gain by the 326 producers in lehman ' s survey reflects  increases in budgets for 2000 and not  underspending of budgets during 1999 . "" among the companies that were  included in our december 1999 and may 2000  surveys , global spending actually came in slightly above what was estimated  to have been spent during 1999 in december . it  also indicates that nearly $ 6 billion has been added to 2000 worldwide  exploration budgets since december , "" crandell said .  the survey ' s respondents said that they planned to increase u . s . e & p  expenditures by 17 . 6 percent , up from 15 . 9 percent  earlier in the year . crandell said that the greater increase was driven  almost entirely by independent producers . "" in our survey ,  227 independents indicated e & p spending growth in 2000 of 26 . 1 percent  versus a 22 . 9 percent increase budgeted for the  year in december , "" he indicated . "" some 40 percent of the independents we  surveyed have increased their u . s . e & p budgets ,  while about 23 percent plan on spending less than what they indicated last  december . higher natural gas prices and increased  cash flow are the main drivers behind this . ""  crandell said that anadarko petroleum corp . ( nyse : apc ) , apache corp . ( nyse :  apa ) , bhp petroleum , h . s . resources inc .  ( nyse : hse ) , mcmoran exploration co . ( nyse : ran ) , mdu resources group inc .  ( nyse : mdu ) , mitchell energy and  development corp . ( nyse : mnd . a and mnd . b ) , santa fe snyder corp . ( nyse :  sfs ) , stone energy corp . ( nyse : sgy ) and  titan exploration inc . - now pure resources inc . ( nyse : prs ) - were among  the larger independents to make the most  significant upward revisions . the ones that significantly reduced planned  u . s . e & p outlays for the year included barrett  resources corp . ( nyse : brr ) , belco oil and gas corp . ( nyse : bog ) , burlington  resources inc . ( nyse : br ) , coastal corp .  ( nyse : cgp ) , forcenergy inc . ( nyse : fen ) , houston exploration co . ( nyse :  hex ) , kerr - mcgee corp . ( nyse : kmg ) , mariner  energy corp . and williams production co .  the survey found that major oil companies plan about the same percentage  gain in their 2000 u . s . e & p expenditures ( 8 . 8  percent ) at midyear as they did at the beginning of the year ( 8 . 4 percent ) .  among the 14 companies in this category , 31  percent made meaningful increases in their 2000 e & p spending estimates  during the first six months , including amerada hess  corp . ( nyse : ahc ) , conoco inc . ( nyse : coc . a and coc . b ) , occidental petroleum  corp . ( nyse : oxy ) and total fina elf s . a .  ( nyse : tot ) . another 19 percent - including eni spa ( nyse : e ) , royal  dutch / shell ( nyse : rdp and stt ) and texaco inc .  ( nyse : tx ) - scaled back their domestic spending estimates , while the  remaining 50 percent of the majors in the survey  remained the same .  ' the increase in canada . . . is nothing short of staggering . . . '  "" the increase in canada indicated by the 85 companies in our survey is  nothing short of staggering , "" crandell continued . of  the 85 companies that he contacted , 44 . 7 percent budgeted higher  expenditures for 2000 than for 1999 . "" compared with  december , 41 percent of them have increased their estimated spending in 2000  by more than 10 percent , while 20 percent  have reduced it by more than 10 percent . the remaining 39 percent have kept  it within 10 percent of what was originally  estimated , "" crandell said . talisman energy inc . ( nyse : tlm ) led the group  with a huge increase , followed by anderson  exploration ltd . ( tse : axl ) , gulf canada resources ltd . ( nyse : gou ) , murphy  oil corp . ( nyse : mur ) , pan canadian  petroleum ltd . ( tse : pcp ) and shell canada ltd . ( tse : shc ) . like their u . s .  counterparts , producers above the border raised  their 2000 e & p budgets in response to higher gas prices and increased cash  flow , according to the lehman analyst .  he said that foreign upstream budgets were an area of surprise : "" the 14 . 9  percent gain indicated by the 99 oil and gas  companies that have operations outside the united states and canada was well  above the 5 . 7 percent increase for 2000  estimated last december . as in other geographies , there were more companies  that increased budgets than decreased them . ""  overall , crandell said that 33 percent of the surveyed companies raised  their 2000 e & p budgets by more than 10 percent , 43  estimated expenditures in roughly the same range and 24 percent indicated  that they would spend less than originally planned .  he said that the larger increases were driven by some big companies which  materially increased their budgets , including  texaco , petroleos brasileiros s . a . , petroleos mexicanos s . a . and repsol ypf  s . a . ( nyse : rep ) among the multinationals and  amerada hess , apache , premier oil plc . and woodside energy among mid - sized  companies .  crandell noted that while respondents ' average price assumptions rose during  2000 ' s first six months ( to $ 22 . 04 from $ 19 . 25  per barrel of crude oil and to $ 2 . 58 from $ 2 . 38 per thousand cubic feet of  natural gas ) , they still trail current prices and what  lehman brothers estimates for the year ( $ 28 per barrel of crude and $ 3 . 30  per mcf of gas ) . "" this suggests a stronger second  half than expected , should companies raise budgets further to reflect the  higher prices , "" he said .  - nick snow in washington  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by john peyton / hou / ect on 06 / 19 / 2000 07 : 36  pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  djcustomclips @ djinteractive . com on 06 / 19 / 2000 08 : 27 : 26 pm  please respond to nobody @ maill . djnr . com  to : 1346 @ wctopics . djnr . com  cc :  subject : energy : oil drilling : survey finds producers plan to spend more than  originally planned in . . .  survey finds producers plan to spend more than originally planned in  2000  oil and gas producers plan to increase their worldwide exploration and  production expenditures by more than they anticipated at the beginning  of the  year , lehman brothers inc . found in a mid - year update of its annual e & p  survey .

"" so many times that  sensible people have learned to discount such claims .  but now a bona fide wolf has arrived , whose predatory behavior is  doing terrible damage to our most populous state  * and nobody will  believe it .  true , california would be heading for a summer of power shortages  even if it had never deregulated . and even if there was workable  competition in the wholesale electricity market , prices in that  market would spike during periods of peak demand , transferring  billions of dollars from either taxpayers or consumers to the  generators .  but the evidence is now overwhelming that there isn ' t workable  competition in california ' s power market , and that the actions of  generators "" gaming the system "" have greatly magnified the crisis .  the key fact is that california has somehow remained in a state of  more or less continuous power shortage and very high wholesale  prices regardless of the level of demand . a rash of outages has  kept the electricity market conveniently  * and very profitably  *  short of supply even during periods of low demand , when there ought  to be lots of excess capacity .  as frank wolak , the stanford economist who also advises the  state ' s power grid , has pointed out , an outage at a power plant is  a lot like an employee calling in sick . you can ' t tell directly  whether he is really sick or has chosen to take the day off for  other reasons , but you can look for circumstantial evidence . and  such evidence has convinced mr . wolak that "" generators use forced  outages strategically to withhold capacity from the market ""  * a  view shared by a growing number of other researchers .  which brings us to the latest move by the federal energy  regulatory commission . on wednesday , the commission apparently  decided to offer california some relief , and put new price caps in  place on the california electricity market . i say "" apparently ""  because the more you look at the plan the less likely it seems to  be any help at all . indeed , the measure was passed on a 2 - to - 1  vote , with william massey  * the one commissioner who has been  sympathetic to calls for price controls  * voting against it on the  grounds that it would be ineffectual .  what ' s wrong with ferc ' s plan ? first , it caps prices only in  emergency conditions  * ignoring the fact that electricity prices  have stayed at hard - to - explain levels even when there is no  emergency . in effect , the plan is laid out as if the electricity  market were really competitive , in spite of all the evidence that  it is not .  second , even those emergency price caps are full of loopholes ,  offering extensive opportunities for what mr . wolak calls "" megawatt  laundering ""  * selling power to affiliated companies that for one  reason or another are exempted from the price controls ( for  example , the controls do not apply to "" imports "" from neighboring  states ) , then selling it back into the california market . severin  borenstein of the university of california energy institute adds  that because the allowed price depends on the cost of generation at  the least efficient plant , generators will have a clear incentive  to produce inefficiently : "" i predict we will find some plants we  never heard of before that are suddenly operating again , and they  will be pretty inefficient . ""  the general verdict seems to be that this is not a serious plan .  there are serious proposals to mitigate the crisis out there  *  indeed , last fall mr . wolak submitted a proposal that was well  received by other experts  * but ferc has ignored all of them .  the charitable interpretation is that ferc still doesn ' t get it ,  that it just can ' t bring itself to believe that this time the wolf  is real . the uncharitable interpretation is that last week ' s action  was meant to fail . the medley report , an online newsletter , calls  the ferc plan "" a grand exercise in posturing without substance . .  . a very clever temporary move by the bush administration to  deflect any political fallout "" from the looming disaster .  whatever the explanation , the plain fact is that ferc and the  administration have yet to offer california any significant  relief .  00 fo 04 b 3 blabf  visit nytimes . com for complete access to the  most authoritative news coverage on the web ,  updated throughout the day .  become a member today ! it ' s free !  http : / / www . nytimes . com ? eta  how to advertise  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  for information on advertising in e - mail newsletters  or other creative advertising opportunities with the  new york times on the web , please contact alyson  racer at alyson @ nytimes . com or visit our online media  kit at http : / / www . nytimes . com / adinfo  for general information about nytimes . com , write to  help @ nytimes . com .  copyright 2001 the new york times company",0

"cera monthly oil briefing - cera alert - december 20 , 2000","title : cera monthly oil briefing : fundamentals update  e - mail category : cera monthly briefing  cera knowledge area : world oil  in the past two weeks , oil prices have sold off the premium or price strength  that had been built into the market in anticipation of possible shortages  this winter . the exact cause of the sharp switch in market psychology is hard  to pinpoint but seems to be a combination of very early signs that the oil  stock situation is at least stabilizing , even if stocks have not built  substantially , and that , thus far , despite a few weeks of colder - than - normal  temperatures , heating oil supply has been adequate to meet demand in the key  us market . that has allayed some of the concerns that were driving  speculative interest into the market . furthermore , the potential for weakness  in the us economy may be creating expectations for weaker oil demand in 2001 .  the change in market psychology was dramatically illustrated when news that  iraq was cutting off exports caused prices to slide , yet , the iraqi export  cutoff is having a concrete effect on fundamentals . if the cutoff lasts  through december , the effect will be pronounced - it would turn a projected  fourth quarter 2000 stockbuild of 0 . 5 million barrels per day ( mbd ) into a  stockdraw of 0 . 1 mbd . we expect iraqi production levels to remain erratic  because of its dispute with the un security council over sanctions , and  exports may again cease . at some point such a development would have a price  supportive effect .  cera ' s price outlook for 2001 remains the same as that in the world oil watch  released in late november . assuming normal winter weather and no prolonged or  repeated shutdowns of iraqi production , the projected average for first  quarter 2001 is $ 29 per barrel for wti . however , this outlook is based on  opec ' s announcing an agreement early in the first quarter to cut its  production by the start of the second quarter . a failure to restrain output  would result in a downward adjustment to an average of $ 27 wti for the first  quarter of 2001 , with prices lower in the second half of the quarter than in  the first . the downward pressure results from the prospect of a  larger - than - usual implied build in stocks during the second quarter of about  3 . 0 mbd - with a cut in opec output .  iraq in a twilight zone  as anticipated , iraq ceased exporting oil under the un - controlled "" oil for  food "" program as of december 1 in protest over the rejection by the security  council ' s sanctions committee of its proposed december export price schedule . *  iraq ' s pricing was judged by the un overseers , who monitor the export program  and advise the sanctions committee , to be about 60 cents per barrel below  comparable crudes in an apparent attempt to offset an illicit surcharge that  iraq was seeking from buyers .  although the standoff with the sanctions committee continues , iraq partially  resumed exporting on december 13 . since then , about 1 mbd has been exported  from the mina al - bakr terminal in the persian gulf . prior to the shutdown ,  iraqi exports under un auspices were at a rate of 2 . 21 mbd for november , as  compared with 2 . 08 mbd for the third quarter . exports for november were about  1 . 3 mbd from mina al - bakr and about 0 . 9 mbd from ceyhan in the mediterranean .  exports from ceyhan have not resumed , owing to the surcharge dispute , with  the result that about 1 . 2 mbd of iraqi crude remains off the market .  iraq ' s semi - shutdown has put it into a kind of twilight zone while its  dispute with the sanctions committee over pricing continues . ( in the midst of  this dispute , the un security council approved phase nine of the oil - for - food  program at the last minute on december 5 ; it became effective on december 6  and has been accepted by iraq ) . as of decemberl 9 , iraq ' s revised export price  for ceyhan , proposed for the remainder of december , has again been judged too  low by the overseers and is expected to be rejected by the sanctions  committee . additionally , the overseers have notified lifters of iraqi crude  that any oil payment made directly to iraq rather than to the un escrow  account would be a violation of un sanctions . buyers of iraqi oil from mina  al - bakr have consistently been reported as saying that they are not paying a  surcharge to iraq .  how long iraq may operate at about half capacity is unclear , but it continues  to request a surcharge payment from prospective lifters at ceyhan in an  apparent effort to circumvent and degrade the un financial controls that are  the heart of the sanctions system . the distinction that iraq has made between  mina al - bakr and ceyhan arose when it resumed operations at mina al - bakr by  loading two cargoes for the india oil company . iraq may have judged this  accommodation to be in its interest , since it recently also signed an oil  exploration contract with india under which payments would be made in oil . as  currently structured , the deal would violate un sanctions , but india is  seeking an exception from the security council on grounds of economic  hardship . the exception seems unlikely to be granted , which may lead iraq to  cease exports from mina al - bakr again .  there are many possible scenarios that iraq could follow , but we expect  uncertainty about iraqi exports to continue as iraq uses its oil exports as  leverage to undermine sanctions in its ongoing struggle with the security  council to end all restraints . consequently , the iraq factor will remain an  element in the oil price outlook .  iraq ' s antisanctions campaign has also raised the visibility of the iraq  issue in washington as the incoming bush administration prepares to take  office . secretary of state - designate colin powell has already acknowledged a  need to reassess iraq policy and has said that he would work to "" reenergize ""  sanctions . the iraq issue is being debated in virtually every foreign  policy - oriented think tank in washington . a consensus seems to be emerging  around seeking renewed international support and legitimacy for sanctions by  retaining un control over iraq ' s oil revenue and strictly enforcing a  prohibition on sales of weapons and related material while lifting general  trade controls that increasingly are both ineffective and an international  irritant . there is virtually no sentiment in favor of operations to  destabilize or remove the saddam hussein regime on the pragmatic basis that  the prospects for success are remote .  demand trends  record high us natural gas prices have increased the economic incentive for  gas consumers with the capability to switch from gas to distillate to do so ,  and reports of switching are emerging in a number of areas . interruptible gas  customers with resid or distillate fuel back - up have already switched to oil ,  so it is now firm gas supply customers with the potential to add to the  already high level of distillate demand . so far in december us distillate  demand is running at a record high december level of 3 . 9 mbd . however , only a  small portion of this demand is the result of economically based  fuel - switching from gas to distillate . cera estimates that the additional  demand likely to come from further switching of gas to distillate is  relatively small , on the order of 0 . 1 to 0 . 2 mbd . in cera ' s view it is likely  that only a portion of the theoretical capacity will be switched on short  notice because in some cases , this theoretically switchable capacity has not  been used in recent years , and tankage and delivery infrastructure may be in  uncertain condition .  switching by interruptible gas customers ( such as utilities ) to distillate  began about a month or more ago , although the volumes involved are relatively  small . switching to residual fuel already occurred months ago when gas prices  started to surge in the summer . a portion of the us secondary and tertiary  distillate stockbuild seen this autumn was likely prompted by interruptible  gas customers filling their reserve distillate fuel storage . given the  expectations of a tight gas market , regulators have been explicit about  enforcing back - up fuel storage requirements in the months leading up to the  current heating season .  other end users of natural gas have few or no options for fuel switching .  some ammonia and ethane producers have shut down operations because the cost  of feedstock natural gas is high . natural gas is also used in some enhanced  oil recovery operations , and some of these producers have also opted to sell  gas back to the grid rather than produce oil .  supply trends  non - opec supply for the fourth quarter is expected to be up 0 . 9 mbd over a  year earlier at 46 . 4 mbd . recent events include a shortfall in mexican  production , curtailed in october by about 300 , 000 bd owing to the effects of  hurricane keith . mexico ' s fourth quarter liquids production is expected to be  3 . 64 mbd - about 95 percent of mexican liquids capacity . norway ' s output  increased 200 , 000 bd from october to november as maintenance season ended .  norway ' s production for the fourth quarter is expected to be 3 . 53 mbd . *  growing russian crude oil production throughout the year is supporting a  recent surge in exports , in spite of higher export taxes . russian exports of  domestic oil production ( excluding transit volumes ) reached 2 . 5 mbd in  november , after remaining fairly steady at about 2 . 35 mbd from july though  october . fourth quarter oil exports are expected to average 2 . 5 mbd , 0 . 3 mbd  greater than in the fourth quarter 1999 .  cera estimates iraqi oil production averaged 2 . 91 mbd in november - down 0 . 1  mbd from the october level . the cutoff in exports earlier this month reduced  iraqi output for the first 12 days of december to roughly 0 . 8 mbd . iraq  resumed exports of about 1 mbd on december 13 , which raised production to  1 . 80 mbd . assuming no change in iraq ' s current production stance , iraqi  production would average 1 . 41 mbd for december . on a quarterly basis , the  decline in iraq output would lead to estimated opec output in the fourth  quarter of 29 . 0 mbd and would turn an estimated global oil stockbuild of 0 . 5  mbd into a stockdraw of 0 . 1 mbd . these production estimates include 0 . 15 mbd  of crude oil exports to syria that began on november 20 without un  authorization and are continuing .  oil stocks  us crude oil inventories ( doe data ) have climbed intermittently from an  annual low of 280 million barrels in september and reached 292 million  barrels in mid - december ( see figure 1 ) . since prices weakened in late  november , crude oil stocks have stabilized above the annual low in september  and the ranges seen in october to levels from 289 - 292 million barrels .  primary inventories of us heating oil remain well below year - earlier levels ;  at 48 million barrels they are 15 million barrels , or 24 percent less , than  those of a year ago , but there are indications of builds in secondary and  tertiary inventories . we estimate that wholesale and consumer stocks are up  5 - 10 million barrels since august and are actually higher than they were at  the end of last year .  in europe crude oil stocks are at more comfortable levels when compared with  those of the united states . in november stocks rose nearly 9 million barrels  to 426 million barrels . at this level they are below the highs of 1999 but  well above the low levels of early 1996 ( see figure 2 ) . japanese crude oil  inventories at end - october were 107 . 6 million barrels , which is above the  record low set earlier this year but still well below levels seen in recent  years ( see figure 3 ) .  come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids :  strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 -

sap timesheets,"hello everyone :  thanks to krishna we have come up with a plan that i believe is going to  save everyone some time . we have created an excel spreadsheet , with  the time sheet form , and there is a tab for each of you , in alphabetical  order  by first name across the bottom of the spreadsheet .  the spreadsheet is saved in o : \ research \ common \ sap timesheets \ mmm - dd .  ( mmm = month and dd = 15 th or end of the month time period - i . e . , this time  period is 7 / 16 - 7 / 31 / 00 ) . the regular 8 hour days have already been entered  for each of you . therefore , if you have no exceptions you just need to type  in  your name in the bottom right corner by the place marked ( emp sign ) , and save  it .  if you do have exception time , simply open that particular pay period and  show the exception time ( off - duty , vacation , overtime , sick time , jury time ,  family  time , etc . ) that you may have had during that pay period . some of the codes  have already been entered for you , the rest are listed at the bottom of the  spreadsheet and just change the ones that are already there for whatever  applies .  if you are an exempt employee you need only show your off - duty time  or exception time . if you are non - exempt you must show all hours worked  and if you have overtime , you must add that to the 8 hours regular time .  there is no code for non - exempt overtime .  this should make it much easier for everyone . however , i will need you to  fill out this timesheet form by the 13 th and 29 th of each month . i will  try and remind you by email the day before .  i would still appreciate your emailing me of any vacation , hod day , or any  other  off - duty that you know about before hand , that way if you are out of pocket  for any  reason and cannot fill in one of the forms , i will be able to fill in your  timesheet for you .  if you have any questions or suggestions , please let me know .  thanks !  shirley",0

a colossal and dangerous failure - cera alert,"title : a colossal and dangerous failure  url : http : / / www 20 . cera . com / eprofile ? u = 35 & m = 2185  overview : western energy  * california governor stays the course  california governor gray davis provided his strongest public statements to  date regarding the state  , s power crisis in his annual state of the state  address on january 8 , 2001 . echoing many of his previous positions on what he  perceives as a flawed and unfair california market structure , the governor  labeled the state  , s electricity market system a colossal and dangerous  failure . among other actions , he launched new initiatives valued at $ 1  billion to encourage conservation , provide financing and land to new  generators , grant authority to utilities to engage in a portfolio of  transactions to manage electricity costs , and increase regulatory scrutiny of  existing market suppliers . the governor also called for a greater role for  the state in overseeing and constructing new power plants .  the governor acknowledged that the actions proposed are only some of the  steps necessary to put california on the road to recovery . details regarding  sources of funding for the initiative are still forthcoming . although he  stated that california  , s investor - owned utilities must not be allowed to go  bankrupt , no formal plan for ensuring their solvency was given . the financial  community continues to lack the assurance it requires to continue to provide  financial backing for pacific gas and electric and southern california  edison . at this time the state legislature remains the body most likely to  guarantee their solvency .  the governor again criticized the federal energy regulatory commission for  what he believes has been its failure to manage and restrain properly the  wholesale market . merchant plant generators were accused of gouging the  state , and it was suggested that these generators acted illegally in their  operations , jeopardizing the reliability of the power grid . new , more severe  sanctions were promised for those caught withholding power or extracting what  investigators find as unreasonable profits .  a los angeles times poll released the morning before the governor  , s address  indicated that the majority of californians still do not believe there is an  energy crisis . although the 33 percent growth in the state  , s economy over the  past ten years has nearly outstripped the state  , s and surrounding region  , s  supplies of power , the bulk of the governor  , s statements continue to focus on  the culpability of power producers , rather than the serious supply shortfall .  though the governor introduced steps to fund and facilitate the construction  of new generating plants , increased regulatory scrutiny and the threat of  sanctions will exacerbate the concern already expressed by plant developers  and the financial community that the investment climate in california is  excessively risky .  * * end * *  follow above url for complete report .  come shoot the rapids with us at ceraweek 2001 , "" shooting the rapids :  strategies and risks for the energy future "" in houston , february 12 - 16 ,  2001 ! for more information and to register , please visit  http : / / www 20 . cera . com / ceraweek /  e - mail category : alert  cera knowledge area ( s ) : western energy ,  to make changes to your cera . com account go to :  forgot your username and password ? go to :  http : / / www 20 . cera . com / client / forgot  this electronic message and attachments , if any , contain information  from cambridge energy research associates , inc .

re : eol pricing algorithm,"hi bob ,  some comments :  1 . you request enron position after successful market order , but not after limit order - - you may want it after limit order as well to be consistent . i am not clear on how you would use enron position . it is possible that the trading desk will have a target position in mind and they will set bids and offers in such a way as to try to achieve that target position , but this target position probably changes continuously and is not stored anywhere , and without this target position there is nothing to compare actual enron position to . of course , enron position may still provide some insights .  2 . you request bid - mid - ask prices for each trade - - - given that a successful trade may execute later than time of order ( especially for limit orders ) , would you need the evolution or range of bid - mid - ask over this time interval ( time of order to time of execution ) ? also , for failed trades , you may need the evolution or range of bid - mid - ask over the time interval from time of order to time of rejection . this again mainly applies to limit orders , as the time intervals may not be significant for market orders given the speed of execution ( something to check ) .  - - - - - original message - - - - -  from : lee , bob  sent : monday , april 23 , 2001 8 : 33 am  to : kaminski , vince ; shanbhogue , vasant ; barkley , tom  cc : lu , zimin ; huang , alex ; gibner , stinson  subject : eol pricing algorithm  a draft data request for eol data we would use to study p & l patterns for the "" george "" pricing algorithm is attached for your review .  i would like to send this to andy zipper and jay webb this afternoon .  bob  >",0

"" he is well - deserving of an immediate promotion ( really more of  a correction ) and pay raise , to be made retroactive at least to the lst of  this month . this memo outlines the circumstances surrounding this hiring  error and provides detailed justifications for this retroactive "" promotion . ""  at the time of the interview process , there was no position in enron  designated as "" professional meteorologist . "" in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he  designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research  web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather  derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and  liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion  and major upgrade of this web page .  these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular  duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,  to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the  advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily  on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his  supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do  not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations  assistance .  in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was  enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a  meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite  of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional  title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly  demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving  of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",0

immediate reply needed,"dear sir ,  i am dr james alabi , the chairman of contract  award and review committee set up by the federal  government of nigeria under the new civilian  dispensation to award new contracts and review  existing ones .  i came to know of you in my search for a reliable and  reputable person to handle a very confidential  transaction , which involves the transfer of a huge  sum of money to a foreign account .  there were series of contracts executed by a  consortium of multi - nationals in the oil industry in  favor of n . n . p . c . the original values of these  contracts were deliberately over invoiced to the sum  of us $ 12 , 320 , 000 . 00 ( twelve million three hundred and twenty thousand  united  state dollars ) . this amount has now been approved and  is now ready to be transferred being that the  companies  that actually executed these contracts have been  fully paid and the projects officially commissioned .  consequently , my colleagues and i are willing to  transfer the total amount to your account for  subsequent disbursement , since we as civil servants  are prohibited by the code of conduct bureau ( civil  service law ) from operating and / or opening foreign  accounts in our names . needless to say , the trust  reposed on you at this juncture is enormous , in  return , we have agreed to offer you 20 % of the  transferred sum , while 10 % shall be set aside for  incidental expenses ( internal and external ) between  both parties in the course of the transaction you will  be mandated to remit the balance to other accounts  in due course .  modalities have been worked out at the highest level  of the ministry of finance and the central bank of  nigeria for the immediate transfer of the funds  within 7 working days subject to your satisfaction of  the above stated terms .  our assurance is that your role is risk free . to  accord this transaction the legality it deserves and  for mutual security of the funds the whole approval  procedures will officially and legally processed  with your name or the name of any company you may  nominate as the bonefide beneficiary .  once more i want you to understand that having put  in over twenty - five years in the civil service of my  country , i am averse to having my image and career  dented . this matter should therefore be treated with  utmost secrecy and urgency it deserves .  please you should signify your intention to assist  by sending me a reply to this email to state your position on this  transaction , if favorable we will take further steps  to brief you the full details of this viable  transaction .  i want to assure you that this business proposal is  100 % risk free as we have done our homework  properly .  i quite believe that you will protect our interest  by taking this deal strictly confidential , as we are  still in government service , which we intend to  retire from in full honor .  kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to  enable us include this transfer in the next batch  which would constitute the new quarter payments  for the 2002 financial year .  thank you and god bless .  dr james alabi",1

"" it ' s a market with mix of small and large players and companies that define  their roles differently , "" said ken weilerstein , an analyst at gartner group  inc . in stamford , conn . enron ' s plan also could help enterprise - level users  get additional benefits along with the storage capacity they ' re renting , such  as security and disaster recovery support , he added .  ravi thuraisingham , director of global bandwidth risk management at enron  broadband services , said the new offering won ' t include additional security  features . but enron does plan to standardize on a set of ssp services and  bundle them with disaster recovery and communications bandwidth capabilities ,  he said .  initially , enron - - which had total revenue of $ 101 billion last year - -  expects to charge users monthly fees of $ 25 to $ 55 per gigabyte of managed  storage , depending on market conditions and the length of time a company  expects to need the capacity . "" we ' re there to try to discover a market  clearing price , "" said thuraisingham , adding that the service is tentatively  due to go online in the third quarter .  enron said it has already signed best buy co . , one of the leading retailers  of consumer electronics , computers and software in the u . s . , to buy the  storage capacity it needs to support a customer relationship management  application through storagenetworks . connecting users such as best buy to  available storage could take anywhere from three days to three months ,  according to thuraisingham .  under enron ' s plan , storage capacity owned by participating ssps will be  connected to an existing network of switching hubs through which the company  currently trades telecommunications bandwidth . enron said it has 18 switching  centers , or "" pooling points , "" in the u . s . , and another seven overseas .  at first , the company plans to focus its attention on ssps in boston and  other metropitan areas where the necessary networking plumbing can be easily  installed . but even there , thuraisingham said , enron is "" pretty much in the  initial stages of getting ssps up to speed on what the market is about . ""  enron has been managing online trades of telecommunications bandwidth since  the spring of 1999 . later that year , it also launched a web site called  enrononline that oversees the trading of natural gas , electricity and other  commodities . that quickly became the world ' s largest e - commerce site and is  now said to be processing more than $ 1 billion worth of transactions daily .  norman levine  enron broadband services  713 - 853 - 5010  norman _ levine @ enron . net",0

energy leader consulting generation evaluator ( ege ),"shirley :  as requested , herein is information regarding the meeting with vince kaminski .  the presentation on the ege tool ' s applications and the allegheny energy case study is timed to take an hour . if the meeting is most conveniently scheduled for tuesday , may 29 , might i request it be set for late afternoon ( as my other appointments are the next day ) .  and , as vince will recall , i was co - leader of the energy consulting business of phb hagler bailly , and developer of the ramp up , real time , 75 check and electric strategy tools . presently , i am ceo of energy leader consulting ( elc ) .  background  the u . s . power generation industry has become increasingly efficient in recent years . rapidly growing new entrants seek profit maximization aggressively . utilities , who still control most power plants , endeavor to adopt the entrants ' methods . yet , inefficiency among many utilities remains widespread .  utility inefficiency arises from adherence to decades - old habits and in unit commitment and dispatch and planned maintenance scheduling . many utilities , notwithstanding the industry - wide trend towards profit maximization , cling to ingrained routines .  inefficiency can also arise from the diseconomies of small scale . a utility may operate a relatively small system ( fewer than a dozen plants ) . a small system lacks portfolio diversification and perspective in its focus on its regulated customers , playing the wholesale market at the margin .  for a variety of reasons , utilities are reluctant to cut back the starts of their generating units , let alone shut down any ( even temporarily or seasonally ) . economically inefficient units continue to be committed , week after week , and run in the half - load range .  ege objectives  ege identifies and assesses generating units of a utility with questionable commitment routines . taking into account transmission and reliability factors , the procedure points towards profit opportunities that may be exploited by another industry participant .  i . an industry participant can use ege as a basis for a medium or long - term wholesale power transaction with a utility ; or to price wholesale power more aggressively , to take market share from the utility ( i . e . , compel changes in unit commitment habits ) .  ii . an industry participant can use ege to spot and quantify efficiencies that would come from a merger or acquisition .  iii . a power plant developer can use ege to estimate the incremental value a new plant will enjoy when the target utility ' s unit commitment routines inevitably become rationalized .  specific ege concepts  ege reduces and analyses the extraordinary but unwieldy continuous emission monitoring data base intelligently focusing on profit opportunities .  it produces indicative statistics such as :  a . the frequency distribution of starts per week ;  b . the frequency distribution of starts by day / 15 - minute segment during the week ;  c . the frequency distribution of load level ;  d . the frequency distribution of hours of operation per start ;  e . average heat rate and approximate fully - allocated cost in the half - load range ;  f . average ramp rate from the half - load range ;  g . the frequency distribution of unused connected capacity during the highest demand hours ; and  h . forced - off maintenance outage rate ( where indicated ) .  indicative statistics are generally aggregated by month / year ; in some cases , by temperature range . ( they can be by regional wholesale prices as well . ) ege establishes if the target utility has changed unit commitment routines significantly in recent years .  ege is based upon uniquely timely actual hourly operating data . ege is now updated for the 4 th quarter 2000 ( through december 31 , 2000 ) . ege lst quarter 2000 ( through march 31 , 2001 ) will be available approximately june 15 , 2001 .  ege also compares and ranks generating units ' commitment and dispatch with that of similar units operated by the target utility ( as well as other regional generators ) . some utilities operate a group of economically marginal units at the half - load level for lengthy time periods ( without an apparent reliability basis ) , splitting the limited economic demand for power among the units .  other ege supporting data :  i . planned maintenance schedule ( where indicated ) ;  j . actual maximum generating capacity ;  k . actual minimum generating capacity ( actual maximums and minimums can differ significantly from government - reported values ) ;  l . average heat rate in the full - load range ; and  m . average heat rate in the three - quarter - load range .  with respect to a generating units ' average heat rate in the half - load , three - quarter - load and full - load ranges , it can be instructive to rank these relative to similar generating units within a region . it can also be of interest to identify significant seasonal variations in average heat rates and maximum capacities , and changes in recent years in these parameters .  the real - world example of allegheny energy  allegheny energy can serve as a case study to illustrate the application of ege . in the 4 th quarter 2000 , for instance , one high - cost generating unit was started virtually every weekday morning ( 52 times ) and committed for the whole day ( in all but two cases ) . arguably , there are power products that could substitute for this routine ( in part at least ) at a profit to the seller of the product and allegheny energy .  another high - cost allegheny energy generating unit was started virtually every weekend during the autumn ( nine times ) and committed for most of the coming week . at another plant , two high - cost units were operated too often in the expensive half - load range ( some 550 hours ) and three - quarter - load range ( another 400 to 600 hours ) ; they were seldom called upon to run at higher levels . again , there are power products that that address these practices and might appeal to allegheny energy .  offering of energy leader consulting ( elc )  ege is a procedure , not a software package or data base . elc believes this format is more effective in arming clients with the information they need to act upon profit opportunities .  elc transfers its "" knowledge "" about the ege procedure and the supporting data methods in a straight - forward four - step process :  1 . enron would select one to three target utilities .  2 . elc would perform the ege procedure on the target utilities .  3 . employing this real - world analysis as a pedagogic tool , elc , in a one - day seminar with enron personnel , would instruct how to perform the procedure in the future ( without the assistance of elc ) .  4 . optionally , elc would provide ege supporting data , quarterly , to enron .  the basic ege supporting data set is national including all generating units under the continuous emission monitoring program ( virtually all fossil fuel units ) . parameters that are incorporated , and the data set format , will be specified upon request . custom modifications will be considered .  steven a . mitnick  chief executive officer  energy leader consulting  4807 41 st street , nw  washington , dc 20016  ( 202 ) 997 - 0924 voice  ( 202 ) 537 - 0906 fax  smitnick @ energyleader . com",0

transport model,"andy ,  the scale effect in the transport model can be explained .  i use a european option to do the illustration .  i raise the underlying and strike price by the same amount , use the fuel  percentage to adjust the strike .  the net result is the intrinsic value decreases as the level goes up .  if the fuel percentage is not very high , the option premium actually  increases with the level , although the  intrinsic value decreases .  if the fuel percentage is very high ( > 8 % ) , then we see a decreasing option  price .  in the transport deal , fuel change is often below 5 % , so you will not see a  decreasing spread option price  when nymex moves up . so i think the transport model still does what it  should do .  zimin  in the following exmaple , i used r = 6 % , vol = 20 % , t = 100 days , see spreadsheet  for details .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by zimin lu / hou / ect on 10 / 20 / 2000 01 : 24 pm  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  zimin lu  10 / 20 / 2000 10 : 45 am  to : andrew h lewis / hou / ect @ ect  cc : colleen sullivan / hou / ect @ ect , stinson gibner / hou / ect @ ect  subject : level effect in transport  andy ,  the following spread sheet domenstrates the leve effect in transport  valuation .  i add an "" nymex add - on "" to both delivery and receipt price curve before fuel  adjustment , keep everything else the same . the transport value ( pv of the  spread options )  increases when nymex add - on increases .  i can visit you at your desk if you have further question .  zimin",0

""  there may be two separate questions to ask here . first , in the context of  the current market ( or the market which may develop in the next 1 - 2 years ) ,  will the metarouter be a commercially viable product ? that is , will it  address an actual need in the market , or would it be more cost effective just  to use technicians with jumper cables to provision circuits ?  the second question ( our first real technical question ) : is the metarouter  technology scalable ? before starting on this project , vince and i will  need to make the proper introductions with the principles who are  implementing this technology .  3 . aggregation of loads . a recurring question comes from a number of areas  such as ip , network storage , and streaming media transport sales : what  value can i get form aggregating customers , each of which has some type of  stochastic load profile ? giuseppe touched on this problem as it relates to  ip transport , but it may be interesting to try and look in more detail .  the main stumbling block may be that we currently have basically no actual  customer data . i am told that in a few months we will have some more useful  history . my understanding is that what will be available will be 5 - minute  averages of usage , so we still will not know on a short time scale what the  distribution of load looks like .  i hope that this gives you enough information to get some idea of what our  concerns are at this point . please let me know your thoughts about these  topics . i would expect , for instance that question number 1 may not be  reasonable as a research project , but might be a question which you would  feel comfortable in addressing by giving us your qualitative opinions , maybe  in the form of a talk here at enron .  again , let me know your thoughts , and i look forward to seeing you again  soon .  stinson  nick bambos on 12 / 20 / 2000 12 : 14 : 40 pm  to : vince . j . kaminski @ enron . com  cc : stinson . gibner @ enron . com  subject : stanford project  hello vince and stinson ,  first of all ,  best wishes for happy holidays ! ! ! !  if you are in the stanford area during the holidays , let ' s get together  some time to have dinner .  i have formally established the project - thanks again for funding  it - and i have also recruited the second phd student . his name is  eric cope , and he is a top - notch student , very mature , and entrepreneurial !  we have started working on some interesting problems in this area . i would  hope that eric could spend the coming summer at enron to get immersed into  the "" problem / opportunity generation environment .

comments,"hi sheridan ,  how are you ? i hope that you had a good vacation . vasant and i looked at  your memo and found it to be interesting . i shall first briefly summarize  our understanding of the methodology you propose . the comments follow .  finally , i shall sketch a simple gas field project you can use as a test case  in further refining the model .  it appears that you are proposing a state - space approach where probabilities  of different states at various future dates are specified . the next step is  to assume a discount rate and to compute the present value by following the  branches from the origin to one of the terminal points . traversing through  the tree in this manner over many iterations will permit us to compute the  average present value of the project . also , you are using the simulation to  assign a value of the project to each node . thus each node will have a cash  flow associated with it which will occur if the node is reached and a value  which is an expectation of the value to be realized going forward . if some  of these values turn out to be negative , zero - coupon , risk - free bonds are  purchased to neutralize the negative realization .  next , we find a comparable and apply the expected rate of return back to our  project ( based on the variance of the returns ) . we iterate until  convergence .  finally , we subtract the initial investment and the computed risk capital  from the pv of the gross cash flows ( including debt ) to determine if the  project merits further consideration .  comments / clarifications  1 . the money is being set aside to avoid negative values . it is not clear  if you mean the values of the cash flow or the pv at the node . anyhow , we  shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes at  that cross - section of time as the risk - free asset pays in all states of  nature . this will have to be done every time there is a negative  realization . thus , for the typical project we have , the value of risk  capital may be extremely high , as we are not following a tail - based norm  anymore .  2 . your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all  values being positive . if so , we are only issuing risk - free debt . also , a  project with a single negative value at each cross - section of time will not  have a positive debt capacity .  3 . it seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate , which is  obtained in each step from the comparison investment ( by equating the  variances ) . it is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such an  effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence . also ,  our project has a finite life and the market - based assets will have infinite  lives . in the light of this fact , how will we define the relevant variance ?  is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison investment ?  4 . finally , our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the investment  and also the risk capital . setting risk capital to zero , this model closely  resembles the intuitive present value criterion and endogenously determines  the discount rate .  gas field case  to facilitate your thinking , we are providing a gas field example below .  we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field . a profile of  expected production and variance of the production per year is available from  the engineers at the beginning . production will be autocorrelated , as the  profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being more or  less than the estimated reserves . we assume the life of the field to be 10  years with no salvage value . there are fixed and variable operating costs .  it might be useful for you to think about applying the framework to this  problem .  do let me know if you have further questions .  rakesh",0
martin lin,"norma ,  thanks for your excellent suggestion of using a retention bonus for martin  lin in order to address both the issues of compensation and retention for  him . as i mentioned during our meeting , just my small team within research  has lost 3 people over about the last 2 years , and we have had a hard time  recruiting good candidates . last year we made an offer to a person  graduating from ut ( ms in computational finance ) of 75 k plus 25 k signing  bonus . he replied that he would like to work at enron but was already in  the position of turning down an offer with a base salary above $ 100 k .  martin is a very skilled individual with a ph . d . in electrical engineering  and almost two years experience at enron . he would be very difficult ( and  expensive ) to replace . for this reason i feel it necessary to be proactive  in finding ways of retaining him as an employee .  please let me know if we have a green light to go forward with a 1 - year  retention bonus of 10 k and a raise to 87 k base salary for mr . lin . i would  plan to then give martin an additional raise at his next review period .  regards ,  stinson  x 34748",0

re : pricing credit on thousands of names,"we can continue the discussion in tuesday ' s conference call , but i discussed  with ben about the issues below , and here are some thoughts . this is not a  complete approach , but only a starting point for discussion .  the main task is to build a pricing system for many names .  this has two components - - -  1 ) how to price a single name ?  1 . 1 ) how to price a liquid single name ?  1 . 2 ) how to price an illiquid single name ?  2 ) how to efficiently apply the methodology to multiple names ?  the approach i would take for 1 . 1 is  a ) define a small set of liquid names  b ) apply each of the different models we have , say , the six models ben has  mentioned below , to these names  c ) include market prices , if any , for these names  d ) sit with traders , get trader ' s intuition on where each liquid name should  price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in ( b ) and ( c )  e ) try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion  of the trader prices across the models  f ) quantify these attributes , if possible  g ) try a different set of liquid names and repeat the process , and see if the  decisions in the last round still make sense  the approach for 1 . 2 may be  a ) define a small set of illiquid names  b ) apply each of the different models we have to these names  c ) sit with traders , get trader ' s intuition on where each illiquid name  should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in ( b )  d ) try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion  of the trader prices across the models  e ) check if these are similar to the attributes identified for liquid names  f ) define a master set of liquid names  g ) look for relationships ( by analyzing cross - section of data ) between  attributes or prices of illiquid names to those of liquid names  once a mapping has been defined for an illiquid name to a set of liquid names  and their attributes , then this mapping can be entered into a table , and the  pricing can be automated for all names ( in theory ) ! the success will depend  on the success of the round - table sessions for the approaches for 1 . 1 and  1 . 2 .  building a new fundamental model is always a worthwhile task , but we can get  going with the above approaches immediately in parallel with developing any  new models that we may build . new models can be added to the suite of  existing models . i do not believe there will ever be a single model that will  answer all questions for all names , but rather we can refine the mappings and  relative choices among models over time , which would mean continuing  round - table sessions with traders . limited data makes calibration very hard ,  so i would continually ask the question "" what do we calibrate ? "" throughout  the discussions for 1 . 1 and 1 . 2 , and this may help guide us to new models .  vasant  benjamin parsons  06 / 19 / 2000 04 : 11 am  to : ect london credit trading  cc : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect , vasant shanbhogue / hou / ect @ ect , amitava  dhar / corp / enron @ enron , steven leppard / lon / ect @ ect , grant masson / hou / ect @ ect ,  dale surbey / lon / ect @ ect , david a wall / risk mgmt / lon / ect @ ect , jitendra j  patel / lon / ect @ ect , oliver gaylard / lon / ect @ ect  subject : pricing credit on thousands of names  all -  our challenge for the next few months is to build an automated system to  provide differential pricing on thousands of credits [ 5 , 000 by year - end ] .  most of these credits will be illiquid in terms of market price information ,  making the challenge harder , and the end result more important in terms of  competitive pricing advantage . what we need is an overall strategy for how we  plan to achieve this from the quantitative perspective .  currently we have several models for credit pricing either in use or under  development :  fmc model ( default probability approach ) . using bloomberg ' s fair market ( par  yield ) curves , probabilities are generated from the risky - libor , then  default / bankruptcy swap prices computed using expectation methodology .  fmc model ( credit spread approach ) . using the fmcs , then directly taking the  libor credit spread at each tenor , adjusting for basis and compounding  differences .  bond model ( fmc approach ) . taking the fmcs as benchmark curves , the model  regresses the input bonds ( specific to a name ) on the two best fitting  benchmarks . the result is a zero yield curve with the same shape as the fmcs ,  but with the level tweaked for the specific issuer . prices are then generated  using both spread and probability approaches . under testing .  bond model ( spline approach ) . taking only the bonds specific to an issuer ,  the model fits an exponential cubic spline to the zero - coupon price curve ,  then builds a zero yield curve from this . under testing .  market prices . for certain liquid names , or sectors / ratings , cds market  prices are used , then recovery and event discount used to get bankruptcy swap  prices .  kmv . using expected default frequencies ( edfs ) from the kmv model and  database , we will build a model to price default swaps , making appropriate  risk adjustments . kmv is being installed now , so model will be worked on next .  each of these models returns a price ( credit default and bankruptcy ) , and the  accuracy of the price depends on many factors - liquidity and regulatory  differences between bond and cds markets , recovery assumptions , risk premia ,  capital charges , etc . the aim will be to accurately price as many liquid  names as possible , based upon these models , then use these prices , alongside  other financial information , as the backbone to a full automated pricing  system .  our inputs to the proposed pricing system for a specific name are model and  market prices for all issuers , alongside name - specific ' soft ' data from  credit reports and financial statements . if the credit is liquid enough , a  price will be generated from their own information only . otherwise , the  credit will be mapped onto a subset of liquid credits , with financial  information and historical price movements providing the mapping and weights .  the model price will then be periodically adjusted to align itself with  market ( or trader ) prices , and this adjustment will feed back into the  weighting and mapping composition . in loose terms , we could think of the  system price for an illiquid credit as being a weighted average of liquid  market prices ( bonds , equities , default swaps ) , where the weightings are  calibrated using credit analysis , financial ratios , etc .  the key steps to implementing such a system will be :  establishing what exactly we want to ' predict ' - is it a price , a rating , a  probability , or a score ?

re : comments,"fyi .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by rakesh bharati / na / enron on 03 / 27 / 2001  07 : 43 pm - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  sheridan titman on 03 / 27 / 2001 06 : 46 : 31 pm  to : rakesh . bharati @ enron . com  cc :  subject : re : comments  rakesh :  thanks for your input . they are quite useful for helping me clarify my own  thinking . the following are my responses to your comments and  clarifications . the * * ed paragraphs are from me and the others are from you .  1 . the money is being set aside to avoid negative values . it is not clear  if you mean the values of the cash flow or the pv at the node . anyhow , we  shall be setting aside money not just for that specific node but all nodes  at that cross - section of time as the risk - free asset pays in all states of  nature . this will have to be done every time there is a negative  realization . thus , for the typical project we have , the value of risk  capital may be extremely high , as we are not following a tail - based norm  anymore .  * * i agree that this is confusing and needs further refinement . i do this  because i have some concerns about discounting negative cash flows , ( this  is discussed in my first memo ) . this clearly provides a conservative  estimate of firm value , and a measure of risk capital that is too high .  from the perspective of evaluating the appropriate level of risk capital ,  it is sufficient that enough capital be employed so that the pv at each  node is positive . also , one might want to set the level so that the pv is  positive in say 98 % of all nodes .  2 . your memo appears to suggest that debt capacity is contingent on all  values being positive . if so , we are only issuing risk - free debt . also , a  project with a single negative value at each cross - section of time will not  have a positive debt capacity .  * * again , this is a very conservative initial estimate . when the model is  refined , you probably want to define debt capacity so that the project  defaults a certain percent of the time .  3 . it seems that our optimization argument is the discount rate , which is  obtained in each step from the comparison investment ( by equating the  variances ) . it is not clear if changing the discount rate will have such  an effect on the project variance so as to lead to a global convergence .  * * i am not assuming that the change in the discount rate has a major effect  on volatility . in fact , i think the process requires only one iteration  when the volatility is independent of the discount rate . again , the idea  is that we calculate the volatility of the project ' s value calculated with  an initial discount rate . using the calculated volatility and the stock of  a comparison firm , calculate a more appropriate discount rate . if the  volatility of the project ' s value is not affected by the change in discount  rates then we are done . if , however , the change in discount rates changes  volatility , then we may have to iterate .  let me know if this makes sense . * *  also , our project has a finite life and the market - based assets will have  infinite lives . in the light of this fact , how will we define the relevant  variance ? is it the spot variance of the returns of the comparison  investment ?  * * this is a good point . i was thinking in terms of the average variance ,  but this may not be correct . actually , we know that this is just an  approximation and we need to think about whether or not it is a good  approximation . typically , firms tend to ignore issues relating to the  duration of their project cash flows when they determine discount rate ,  which clearly does not make sense . this requires some additional thought . * *  4 . finally , our criterion is to subtract from the average pv the  investment and also the risk capital . setting risk capital to zero , this  model closely resembles the intuitive present value criterion and  endogenously determines the discount rate .  * * this is correct . my goal was to come up with something that was closely  related to what you are already doing but which gives you some insight into  how to define risk capital and the appropriate discount rate . there are a  number of ways that we can refine and improve this procedure . what we need  to first consider is whether or not the basic approach makes sense for the  kind of projects that you are evaluating . * *  gas field case  to facilitate your thinking , we are providing a gas field example below .  we invest x million dollars to buy and develop a gas field . a profile of  expected production and variance of the production per year is available  from the engineers at the beginning . production will be autocorrelated , as  the profile will shift up or down based on the actual gas reserves being  more or less than the estimated reserves . we assume the life of the field  to be 10 years with no salvage value . there are fixed and variable  operating costs . it might be useful for you to think about applying the  framework to this problem .  * * this problem is probably pretty straightforward because it is unlikely  that the cash flows will be negative once the gas field is producing .  hence , there is no need to be concerned about risk capital ( other than the  x million dollars to buy and develop the property ) . to value the property  assuming all - equity financing we calculate the value process of the  developed project and compare its volatility to a comparison investment  whose value process is observable ( e . g . , a traded mlp ) . the risk - adjusted  return of the comparison investment would then be used to discount the cash  flows of the gas field .  please note that this procedure requires relatively strong assumptions and  calculating the risk - adjusted return on the comparison investment is not  necessarily straightforward . * *  let me know when you would like to discuss this .  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *  on another topic , is it possible for you to give me information about one  case where enron bought or sold a base load power plant , where the  purchaser financed the transaction with non - recourse debt . we would like  the following information :  1 . the value of the power plant ( or purchase price )  2 . the amount of debt financing and the terms of the debt contract .  3 . some information about the pricing of gas - power swaps and options .  about a year ago i gave vince a paper which develops a pricing model for  project debt . i don ' t think he thought that it could be implemented on the  type of projects that enron finances . however , my coauthors would like to  try applying the model for one case study .  let me know when you want to discuss these issues .  thanks ,  sheridan  sheridan titman  department of finance  college of business administration  university of texas  austin , texas 78712 - 1179  512 - 232 - 2787 ( phone )  512 - 471 - 5073 ( fax )  titman @ mail . utexas . edu",0

partnership,"mr . edward moko  18 independence close ,  johannesburg ,  south africa .  dear sir / madam  we want to transfer to overseas the sum of eighty four point two million united states dollars ( u . s . $ 84 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) from a bank in africa .  i want to ask you to kindly look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new bank account immediately to receive this money , though an empty bank account could serve this purpose as long as you will remain honest to me till the end of this important business trusting in you and believing in god that you will never let me down either now or in time to come .  i am mr . edward moko . the external auditor of a bank . during the course of our auditing , i discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the bank in 1998 and since 2001 nobody has operated on this account gain . after going through some old files in the records , i discovered that the owner of the account died without a "" heir apparent to the throne "" hence the money is floating and if i do not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing . the owner of this account who is mr . eshed . b . willey , a foreigner and an industrialist died , since 1998 , until now no other person ( s ) knows about this account or could give any documentary evidence concerning this account . as such this account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that eshed . b . willey until his death was the manager oriental diamond company , in south africa . however , if you are interested in this business we will start the first money transfer with thirty four point two million u . s . dollars ( u . s . $ 34 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) upon successful transaction without any disappointment from you . we shall also re - apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account . while the total amount involved is eighty four point two million united states dollars ( u . s . $ 84 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) only . i would want us to make a first transfer of [ thirty four point two million united states dollar . u . s . $ 34 . 2 , 000 , 000 . 00 ) from this money into a safe foreigners account abroad before the rest . i am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local account , without valid international foreign "" agreement "" , but could only be approved to any foreigner with valid international credentials : passport or drivers license and foreign account because this sum is in u . s . dollars and the former owner of the account mr . eshed . b . willey is a foreigner too , thus the money could only be approved into a foreign account . however , knowing all this , we will reach a binding agreement in this regards .  as a matter of urgency , i will inform you the next step to take , while you send your private telephone and fax number including the full details of the account to be used for the deposit . i want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding agreement that will bind us together before transferring the money to any account of your choice where the fund will be safe . before we fly to your country for withdrawal , sharing and investments , i need your full co - operation to make this business a success , because the management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account , which i will give to you , upon your positive response and once i am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with the instructions of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business . i need your strong assurance that you will never let me down . with my influence and the position in the bank we can transfer this money to any foreigner ' s reliable account which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in your country for sharing . and to build confidence that you can come immediately to discuss with me face to face after which i will make this remittance in your presence and three of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going into the account . i will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately i hear from you that you are ready to act as directed . to prove the authenticity of the business i will use my position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from the relevant ministries , foreign exchange departments , embassy and board of internal revenue services . at the conclusion of this business , you will be given 35 % of the total amount , 60 % will be for me , while 5 % will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during this process .  i look forward to your earliest reply through my email address .  respectfully  mr . edward moko .",1

petrochem desk,"i had a chance to speak with christian lebroc this morning with regard to curve building for petrochemicals . as it turns out , christian left rac in april and joined the petrochem desk as a trader . previous efforts at construction of a forward curve by the group have focused on intuition or swags . unfortunately , the group had a rough p & l year with at least some of the blame directed toward the forward curve or lack thereof . when asked about the fundamentals group , christian indicated that they ' d only been around about 3 - 4 months and are not yet well - suited to curve building . john nowlan is indeed the head of the group .  from a timing perspective , i told christian that it would probably take at least 6 - 8 weeks to develop a curve , especially considering the need to understand the key market drivers / fundamentals . as was suggested yesterday during our meeting , a strong relationship between petrochemicals and a nymex component ( e . g . , crude oil ) would provide a great beginning point - - we could then potentially strengthen / augment this relationship with other key factors ( e . g . , supply and demand terms ) borne out of our market research .  nelson",0

come on ! it ' s fun and easy ! !,"* * * please read this email to the end * * *  try it . just for fun . it will cost you 25 $ to earn at least thousands of dollars ! ! ! this thing  is legal because you are buying and selling something of value : marketing reports .  there is my true story .  i received by email the instructions include in this letter . it interests me because the  system was quite simple . in the list of people selling the reports ( as you will see above ) ,  there was a guy living not so far . i searched for his phone number and i called him . i just  wanted to know if this system was really working . he told me his business was going  very well and he was receiving from 50 $ to 150 $ in cash everyday ! that ' s why i went  into this thing !  thank ' s to the computer age and the internet !  be an internet millionaire like others within a year ! ! !  before you say ' ' bull ' ' , please read the following . this is the letter you have been hearing  about on the news lately . due to the popularity of this letter on the internet , a national  weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program  described below , to see if it really can make people money . the show also investigated  whether or not the program was legal .  their findings proved once and for all that there are ' ' absolutely no laws prohibiting the  participation in the program and if people can "" follow the simple instruction "" they are  bound to make some mega bucks with only $ 25 out of pocket cost ' ' .  = = print this now for your future reference = =  if you would like to make at least $ 500 , 000 every 4 to 5 months easily and comfortably ,  please read the following . . . then read it again and again ! ! !  follow the simple instruction below and  your financial dreams will come true , guaranteed !  instructions :  = = = = = order all 5 reports shown on the list below = = = = =  for each report , send $ 5 cash , the name & number of the report you are  ordering and your e - mail address to the person whose name appears on  that list next to the report . make sure your return address is on your  envelope top left corner in case of any mail problems .  = = = when you place your order , make sure = = =  = = = you order each of the 5 reports ! = = =  you will need all 5 reports so that you can save them on your computer and resell them .  your total cost $ 5 x 5 = $ 25 . 00 .  within a few days you will receive , via e - mail , each of the 5 reports from these 5 different  individuals . save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the  1 , 000 ' s of people who will order them from you . also make a floppy of these reports and  keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer .  important - do not alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report ,  or their sequence on the list , in any way other than what is instructed below in step ' ' 1  through 6 ' ' or you will loose out on the majority of your profits . once you understand the  way this works , you will also see how it does not work if you change it .  remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter it , it will not work ! ! ! people  have tried to put their friends / relatives names on all five thinking they could get all the  money . but it does not work this way . believe us , some have tried to be greedy and then  nothing happened . so do not try to change anything other than what is instructed .  because if you do , it will not work for you . remember , honesty reaps the reward ! ! !  this is a legitimate business . you are offering a product for sale and getting paid for it .  treat it as such and you will be very profitable in a short period of time .  1 . . after you have ordered all 5 reports , take this advertisement and remove the name  & address of the person in report # 5 . this person has made it through the cycle and  is no doubt counting their fortune .  2 . . move the name & address in report # 4 down to report # 5 .  3 . . move the name & address in report # 3 down to report # 4 .  4 . . move the name & address in report # 2 down to report # 3 .  5 . . move the name & address in report # 1 down to report # 2  6 . . . . insert your name & address in the report # 1 position .  please make sure you copy every name & address accurately ! this is critical  to your success .  take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . do  not make any other changes .  save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data . to assist you with  marketing your business on the internet , the 5 reports you purchase will provide you with  invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e - mails legally , where  to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . there are 2 primary methods to  get this venture going :  method # 1 : by sending bulk e - mail legally  let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume you  and those involved send out only 5 , 000 e - mails each . let ' s also assume that the mailing  receive only a 0 . 2 % ( 2 / 10 of 1 % ) response ( the response could be much better but lets  just say it is only 0 . 2 % ) . also many peoplewill send out hundreds of thousands e - mails  instead of only 5 , 000 each ) .  continuing with this example , you send out only 5 , 000 e - mails . with a 0 . 2 % response ,  that is only 10 orders for report # 1 . those 10 people responded by sending out 5 , 000 e -  mail each for a total of 50 , 000 . out of those 50 , 000 e - mails only 0 . 2 % responded with  orders . that ' s = 100 people responded and ordered report # 2 .  those 100 people mail out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 500 , 000 e - mails . the 0 . 2 %  response to that is 1000 orders for report # 3 .  those 1000 people send 5 , 000 e - mail each for a total of 5 million e - mail sent out . the  0 . 2 % response is 10 , 000 orders for report # 4 .  those 10 , 000 people send out 5 , 000 e - mails each for a total of 50 , 000 , 000 ( 50 million ) e -  mails . the 0 . 2 % response to that is 100 , 000 orders for report # 5 .  that ' s 100 , 000 orders times $ 5 each = $ 500 , 000 . 00 ( half a million dollars ) .  your total income in this example is : 1 . . . . . $ 50 + 2 . . . . . $ 500 + 3 . . . . . $ 5 , 000 + 4 . . . . .  $ 50 , 000 + 5 . . . . $ 500 , 000 . . . .  grand total = $ 555 , 550 . 00  numbers do not lie . get a pencil & paper and figure out the worst  possible responses and no matter how you calculate it , you will  still make a lot of money !  remember friend , this is assuming only 10 people ordering out of  5 , 000 you mailed to . dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or  half or even one 4 th of those people mailed 100 , 000 e - mails each or more ?  there are over 150 million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands  more coming on line every day . believe me , many people will do just that , and more !  method # 2 : by placing free ads on the internet  advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of free places  to advertise . placing a lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response . we  strongly suggest you start with method # 1 and add method # 2 as you go along . for  every $ 5 you receive , all you must do is e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it .  always provide same day service on all orders .  this will guarantee that the e - mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will  be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report .  = = = = = = = = = = = available reports = = = = = = = = = = = = = =  the reason for the "" cash "" is not because this is illegal or somehow "" wrong "" . it is simply  about time . time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc . concealing it  is simply so no one can see there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to  you .  order each report by its number & name only . notes : always send $ 5  cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not accepted . make sure the cash is  concealed by wrapping it in at least 2 sheets of paper . on one of those sheets of paper ,  write the number & the name of the report you are ordering , your e - mail  address and your name and postal address .  place your order for these reports now :  = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = report # 1 : ' the insider ' s  guide to advertising for free on the net  order report # 1 from :  y . l . wong  p . o . box no . 71819  kowloon central post office  hong kong  report # 2 : the insider ' s guide to sending bulk email on the net  order report # 2 from :  martin veronneau  c . p . 70058  laval , quebec  h 7 r 5 z 2  canada  report # 3 : secret to multilevel marketing on the net  order report # 3 from :  francis kidd  p . o . box 209  homestead , pa 15120  usa  report # 4 : how to become a millionaire using mlm & the net  order report # 4 from :  m . l . frayser  p . o . box 61432  fort myers , fl 33906  usa  report # 5 : how to send out one million emails for free  order report # 5 from :  stone evans  600 n . pearl , suite gl 03  dallas , tx 75201  usa  $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ your success guidelines $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $  follow these guidelines to guarantee your success :  = = = if you do not receive at least 10 orders for report # 1 within 2 weeks , continue  sending e - mails until you do .  = = = after you have received 10 orders , 2 to 3 weeks after that you should receive 100  orders or more for report # 2 . if you did not , continue advertising or sending e - mails  until you do .  * * once you have received 100 or more orders for report # 2 , you can relax , because  the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! this is  important to remember : every time your name is moved down on the list , you are  placed in front of a different report .  you can keep track of your progress by watching which report people are  ordering from you . if you want to generate more income send another  batch of e - mails and start the whole process again . there is no limit  to the income you can generate from this business ! ! !  following is a note from the originator of this program :  you have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your  life , with no risk and just a little bit of effort . you can make more money in  the next few weeks and months than you have ever imagined . follow the program  exactly as instructed . do not change it in any way . it works exceedingly well as  it is now .  remember to e - mail a copy of this exciting report after you have put your name and  address in report # 1 and moved others to # 2 . . . . . # 5 as instructed above . one of the  people you send this to may send out 100 , 000 or more e - mails and your name will be on  every one of them .  remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach .  so my friend , i have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to  become financially independent .  it is up to you now !

""  with network marketing you have two sources of income . direct  commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from  sales made by people you introduce to the business .  residual income is the secret of the wealthy . it means investing  time and money once , and getting paid again and again and again .  in network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of  others .  the enclosed information is something i almost let slip through my  fingers . fortunately , sometime later i reread everything and gave  some thought and study to it .  my name is jonathan rourke . two years ago , the corporation i  worked at for the past twelve years down - sized and my position  was eliminated . after unproductive job interviews , i decided to  open my own business . over the past year , i incurred many  unforeseen financial problems . i owed my family , friends and  creditors over $ 35 , 000 . the economy was taking a toll on my  business and i just couldn ' t seem to make ends meet . i had to  refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and  struggling business . at that moment something significant happened  in my life and i am writing to share that experience in hopes that  this will change your life forever financially ! ! !  in mid december , i received this program via e - mail . six month ' s  prior to receiving this program , i had been sending away for  information on various business opportunities . all of the programs  i received , in my opinion were not cost effective . they were  either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial  investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work  or not . one claimed that i would make a million dollars in one  year . it didn ' t tell me i ' d have to write a book to make it !  but like i was saying , in december i received this program . i  didn ' t send for it , or ask for it ; they just got my name off a  mailing list . thank goodness for that ! ! !  after reading it several times , to make sure i was reading it  correctly , i couldn ' t believe my eyes .  here was a money making phenomenon .  i could invest as much as i wanted to start without putting me  further into debt . after i got a pencil and paper and figured it  out , i would at least get my money back . but like most of you i  was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal  aspects of it all . so i checked it out with the u . s . post office  ( 1 - 800 - 725 - 2161 24 hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed  legal ! after determining the program was legal and not a chain  letter , i decided "" why not . ""  initially i sent out 10 , 000 e - mails . it cost me about $ 15 for my  time on - line . the great thing about e - mail is that i don ' t need  any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of  my orders are filled via e - mail , the only expense is my time . i am  telling you like it is . i hope it doesn ' t turn you off , but i  promised myself that i would not ' rip - off "" anyone , no matter how  much money it cost me .  here is the basic version of what you need to do :  your first goal is to receive at least 20 orders for report # 1  within 2 weeks of your first program going out . if you don ' t , send  out more programs until you do .  your second goal is to receive at least 150 + orders for report # 2  within 4 weeks . if not , send out more programs until you do .  once you have your 150 orders , relax , you ' ve met your goal . you  will make $ 50 , 000 + but keep at it ! if you don ' t get 150 right off ,  keep at it ! it may take some time for your down line to build .  keep at it , stay focused , and do not let yourself get distracted .  in less than one week , i was starting to receive orders for report  # 1 . i kept at it - kept mailing out the program and by january 13 ,  1 had received 26 orders for report # 1 . my first step in making  $ 50 , 000 in 90 days was done .  by january 30 , 1 had received 196 orders for report # 2 ; 46 more  than i needed . so i sat back and relaxed . by march 1 , of my  e - mailing of 10 , 000 , i received $ 58 , 000 with more coming in every  day . i paid off all my debts and bought a much needed new car .  please take time to read the attached program , it will change your  life forever ! ! remember , it won ' t work if you don ' t try it . this  program does work , but you must follow it exactly ! especially the  rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . it  won ' t work , you ' ll lose out on a lot of money !  in order for this program to work very fast , try to meet your goal  of 20 + orders for report # 1 , and 150 + orders for report # 2 and you  will make $ 50 , 000 or more in 90 days . if you don ' t reach the first  two goals with in four weeks , relax , you will still make a ton of  money , it may take a few months or so longer . but keep mailing out  the programs and stay focused ! that ' s the key . i am living proof  that it works ! ! ! if you choose not to participate in this program ,  i am sorry . it really is a great opportunity with little cost or  risk to you . if you choose to participate , follow the program and  you will be on your way to financial security .  if you are a fellow business owner and are in financial trouble  like i was , or you want to start your own business , consider this  a sign . i did ! - sincerely , jonathan rourke  p . s . do you have any idea what 11 , 700 $ 5 bills ( $ 58 , 000 ) look  like piled up on a kitchen table ? it ' s awesome !  a personal note from the originator of this program :  by the time you have read the enclosed program and reports , you  should have concluded that such a program , and one that is legal ,  could not have been created by an amateur .  let me tell you a little about myself . i had a profitable business  for 10 years . then in 1979 my business began falling off . i was  doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but  it wasn ' t working .  finally , i figured it out . it wasn ' t me ; it was the economy .  inflation and recession had replaced the stable economy that had  been with us since 1945 .  i don ' t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment  rate . . . because many of you know from first hand experience . there  were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before .  the middle class was vanishing . those who knew what they were  doing invested wisely and moved up . those who did not including  those who never had anything to save or invest were moving down  into the ranks of the poor .  as the saying goes , ' the rich get richer and the poor get poorer . ""  the traditional methods of making money will never allow you to  "" move up "" or "" get rich "" . inflation will see to that .  you have just received information that can give you financial  freedom for the rest of your life , with "" no risk "" and "" just a  little bit of effort .

copy  and paste method works well , .  3 . take this entire letter , including the modified list of names ,  and save it to your computer . make no changes to the instruction  portion of this letter .  your cost to participate in this is practically nothing ( surely  you can afford $ 25 ) . you obviously already have an internet  connection and e - mail is free !  to assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the 5  reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing  information which includes how to send bulk e - mails , where to find  thousands of free classified ads and much , much more .  here are two primary methods of building your downline :  method # 1 : sending bulk e - mail  let ' s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes ,  and we ' ll assume you and all those involved send out only 2 , 000  programs each . let ' s also assume that the mailing receives a 0 . 5 %  response . using a good list , the response could be much better .  also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of programs  instead of 2 , 000 . but continuing with this example , you send out  only 2 , 000 programs . with a 0 . 5 % response , that is only 10 orders  for report # 1 . those 10 people respond by sending out 2 , 000  programs each for a total of 20 , 000 . out of those 0 . 5 % , 100 people  respond and order report # 2 .  those 100 mail out 2 , 000 programs each for a total of 200 , 000 . the  0 . 5 % response to that is 1 , 000 orders for report # 3 . those 1 , 000  send out 2 , 000 programs each for a 2 , 000 , 000 total . the 0 . 5 %  response to that is i 0 , 000 orders for report # 4 . that amounts to  10 , 000 each of $ 5 bills for you in cash money ! then think about  level five ! that ' s $ 500 , 000 alone !  your total income in this example is $ 50 + $ 500 + $ 5 , 000 + $ 50 , 000  + $ 500 , 000 for a total of $ 555 , 550 ! ! !  remember friend , this is assuming 1 , 990 out of the 2 , 000 people  you mail to will do absolutely nothing and trash this program !  dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone , or half  sent out 100 , 000 programs instead of 2 , 000 . believe me , many  people will do just that and more !  report # 2 will show you the best methods for bulk e - mailing , and  e - mail software .  method # 2 - placing free ads on the internet  1 . advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive , and there are  hundreds of free places to advertise . let ' s say you decide to  start small just to see how well it works . assume your goal is to  get only 10 people to participate on your first level . placing a  lot of free ads on the internet will easily get a larger response .  also assume that everyone else in your organization gets only 10  downline members . follow this example to achieve the staggering  results below : lst level - your 10 members with $ 5 . . . . . . . $ 50  2 nd level - 10 members from those 10 ( $ 5 x 100 ) . . . . . . . $ 500  3 rd level - 10 members from those 100 ( $ 5 x 1 , 000 ) . . . . . . . $ 5 , 000  4 th level - 10 members from those 1 , 000 ( $ 5 x 10 k ) . . . . . . . $ 50 , 000  5 th level - 10 members from those 10 , 000 ( $ 5 x 100 k ) . . . . . . . $ 500 , 000  this totals - $ 555 , 550  remember friends , this assumes that the people who participate  only recruit 10 people each . think for a moment what would happen  if they got 20 people to participate ! most people get 100 ' s of  participants .  think about it ! for every $ 5 . 00 you receive , all you must do is  e - mail them the report they ordered . that ' s it ! always provide  same - day service on all orders ! this will guarantee that the  e - mail they send out with your name and address on it will be  prompt because they can ' t advertise until they receive the report !  available reports * * * order each report by number , and  name * * *  * always send $ 5 cash ( u . s . currency ) for each report . checks not  accepted * - always send your order via first class mail - make  sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least two sheets  of paper ( so that the bill can ' t be seen against light ) on one of  those sheets of paper include :  ( a ) the number & name of the report you are ordering ,  ( b ) your e - mail address , and  ( c ) your name & postal address ( in case your e - mail provider  encounters problems ) .  place your order for these reports now :  report # 1 "" the insiders guide to advertizing for free on the  internet ""  order report # 1 from :  randy dillard  p . o . box 8  osprey , fl 34229  usa  report # 2 "" the insiders guide to sending bulk email on the  internet ""  order report # 2 from :  carla brown  p . o . box 39093  sarasota , fl 34238  usa  report # 3 "" the secrets to multilevel marketing on the internet ""  order report # 3 from :  glynn schmidt  p . o . box 19424  sarasota , fl 34276  usa  report # 4 ' how to become a millionaire utilizing the power of  multilevel marketing and the internet ""  order report # 4 from :  christin joy  cpo 2398  501 e . college avenue  wheaton , il 60187  usa  report # 5 "" how to send one million e - mails for free .

re : equity investment fair value in turkey,"john ,  it seems to me that using a risk - free rate is not appropriate . i shall  elaborate on my  position and send you a longer message this afternoon ( my time ) .  vince  enron capital & trade resources corp . - europe  from : john bottomley 06 / 19 / 2000 05 : 55 am  to : vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  cc : john sherriff / lon / ect @ ect , dale surbey / lon / ect @ ect  subject : equity investment fair value in turkey  vince ,  john sherriff recommended that i contact you regarding an interesting ( and  potentially contentious ) option valuation issue we are currently dealing with  in london . we hold longish term options in a private company in turkey which  is currently seeking to ipo . the issue we are discussing with rac is which  discount rate ( i . e . , risk - free ? and if so turkish or us ? ) should we use to  value these options  first , some additional information .  option characteristics :  - - 116 , 000 options ( representing 9 % of the company )  - - term : minimum of 3 years but possibly longer - - still being renegotiated  - - strike price : 20 % below the upcoming ipo price ( either priced in us $ or  turkish lire )  we currently hold the above number of options with a fixed price of $ 118 . 75  per option but 34 , 800 expire on july 15 , 2000 with the remainder expiring on  december 15 , 2000 . the company ' s investment bankers ( abn / amro rothchilds )  are concerned regarding the strike price because it values the company at  $ 118 million and they believe the company is worth approx $ 300 million . due  to such a large "" valuation gap "" , they originally encouraged us to exercise  all of the options by the end of june ( ipo target date in late sept / early  oct ) . our counter - proposal is to "" swap "" instrinsic value for time value by  repricing the options strike higher while extending their term .  we are currently negotiating with rac the most appropriate discount rate to  use to value the options . we are arguing that the us risk free is the most  appropriate discount rate and their current position is that the company ' s  historical senior debt cost ( 18 % ) is the more appropriate number to use  ( although admit that this is not justifiable - - only a proxy )  a few key points :  - - rac is valuing the options via crystal ball simulations such that this "" to  be negotiated "" discount rate is used to calculate the pv of the future  options intrinsic value in 3 years  ( i . e . , for black - scholes , a higher discount rate yields a higher value but  the opposite is true using crystal ball simulation )  - - the model simulates both an ipo / no ipo case and in the case of no ipo we  have put options for our equity priced at a fixed 17 % return  - - the model assigns a 30 % illiquidity discount  - - in the simulated cases where the options are out - of - the - money , we  obviously do not exercise .  we understand that for black - scholes option valuation , one needs to be able  to construct a comparable portfolio of cash flows using equity futures and  the risk free in order for the valuation to hold . and here is where we reach  our difficulty : since the company doesn ' t currently trade on a public market  and since equity futures do not exist for turkish equities , rac is arguing  that a us risk free is not appropriate to use . our argument is that the  non - ipo scenario , a 30 % illiquidity discount and a us $ based option  volatility are already in the factored into the simulation . as such , we feel  rac ' s approach is double counting .  if you managed to get through the above , your a patient man ! i ' ll give you a  call today or tomorrow after you ' ve had a chance to digest the information .  regards ,  john bottomley",0

charity sees the need not the cost . . .,"dear friend ,  as you read this , i don ' t want you to feel sorry for me , because , i believe everyone will die someday . my name is mr . reza abdulla , a merchant in safat , in ( kuwait ) i was married with two children . my wife and two children died in a car accident six years a go . i have been diagnosed with esophageal cancer . it has defiled all forms of medical treatment , and right now i have only about a few months to live , according to medical experts .  i have not particularly lived my life so well , as i never really cared for anyone ( not even myself ) but my business . though i am very rich , i was never generous , i was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as that was the only thing i cared for . but now i regret all this as i now know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world .  i believe when god gives me a second chance to come to this world i would live my life a different way from how i have lived it . now that god has called me , i have willed and  given most of my property and assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends . i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul so , i have decided to give alms to charity organizations , as i want this to be one of the last good deeds i do on earth . so far , i have distributed money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e , algeria and malaysia . now that my health has deteriorated so badly , i cannot do this myself anymore . i once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money which i have there to charity organization in bulgaria and pakistan , they refused and kept the money to themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore , as they seem not to be contended with what i have left for them . the last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of ten million seven hundred thousand american dollars ( u . s . $ 10 . 700 , 000 ) that i have with a finance / security company abroad . i will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations . i have set aside only 20 % for you and for your time and also 5 % as miscellaneous expenses . reply me at your earliest convenience for more directives to my private email address : reza _ abdulla @ walla . com  god be with you .  regards ,  mr . reza abdulla",1

a & a math majors,"vince ,  thank you so much for meeting with me friday morning about the research  group .  after leaving your office , i remembered an issue i have had with the analyst  & associate program that might be of interest to you .  during a texas a & m recruiting meeting , i learned that we have expanded our  list of majors to include computer science . i wondered why math majors were  not mentioned , and was told that there was not a business need for math  majors . like liberal arts majors , they said math majors were only considered  on a person by person basis . in my opinion , math majors have many of the  same skills as finance majors , and can easily adjust to accounting rotations  as well ( i did last summer , and finance majors in the program are forced to  every year . ) i think that enron is missing out on many qualified candidates  by limiting their recruitment effort .  at texas a & m the career center asks companies for a list of majors they are  targeting , and only allows those majors to sign up for interviews through the  career center . i sent my resume to enron and asked to be included in the  interview process on campus . however , many other math majors had not heard  of enron or the other companies , and assumed that there was no place for a  math major at a company like enron . many math majors want to continue their  education , become teachers , or work for an actuarial firm . however , many  are undecided . we are constantly told of the many business possibilities  available to math majors by our teachers and staff , but many undergraduates  are still not sure exactly what math majors can contribute in a business  environment . by not mentioning math majors to the career center ( a very  simple and inexpensive step ) , enron is losing out on a very talented pool of  people . while it would be nice to get the math majors that knew about enron  already , had thoroughly researched all companies and determined that math  majors would fit perfectly , and went the extra step to send enron their  resume outside the career center system , there are many qualified students  who do not do this , and opt for other companies who did mention math majors .  i called a manager in the a & a program to suggest that we consider at least  mentioning math majors to the career centers . i realize that it may cost  more to actively pursue them , talk to teachers , and attend math society  events . however , i told her that including them at the career center would  be very inexpensive for enron . she reiterated that they saw no business need  for math majors , and that if more upper level people began requesting them ,  it would be considered . i searched for "" mathematics "" on the enron job  website , and had a surprising number of results . i know that your group  could use math majors as well . however , this still may be too small a number  to merit a focus from the a & a recruiting department . i just wanted to bring  it to your attention in case it was something that you felt should be changed .  thanks ,  heather johnson  x 53240",0
re : ca for henwood engagement,"stinson ,  attached please find a draft consulting agreement for use with henwood .  you will want to review it before you send it to henwood . please see section  6 in particular . also , i put in that arbitration will be in houston and  texas law will apply . we could move that to new york , with new york law if  that is better for henwood . if pressed , we could make it singapore or u . k .  law , with arb in singapore . but any other law , including australian law ,  would mean we would need to get this contract reviewed by foreign counsel - - so  i strongly urge you to argue for texas or ny law ( no other state , please ) .  i tried to make this agreement reflect the terms in henwood ' s proposal , and  believe i succeeded . our form has some additional terms not contained in  their proposal , as well as fcpa boilerplate ( ie . , the "" business conduct "" and  "" drug policy "" language ) . also , i just want to point out that this agreement  allows them to subcontract the work - - but only with our written agreement .  under their proposal , the subcontractor costs will be charged to us at cost  plus 15 % - - so you might not want to do it .  please let me know if you have any comments or questions .  bonnie",0

"" i gather that "" exotic  options "" is the one you intend to use in your class , correct ?  by the way , i queried participants in my class , and i heard that the case  study approach we occaisionally used was appreciated by several . the var  class i taught was from jorian ' s book , which has no exercises and which  assumes a particular background in finance and statistics . i created a  problem ( not exactly a case study ) that required participant to learn some  statistics and try some different approaches . from this , participants got a  better idea of why one bothers with certain issues . some liked the "" real  world "" flavor of this kind of approach . ( without the case approach , you could  provide good counterexampes as a partial remedy . )  best regards and season ' s greetings ,  michael",0
investment opportunity .,"dear friend ,  you will be surprise to see this message but i got your information  through spartanburg , area chamber of commerce usa .  my name is howard jones , a chief auditor , during my last auditing in  the  in london , uk we realized the sum $ 35 . 5 million owned by one patric zuma  from egypt who died  in a fatal motor accident in nov . 15 , 2004 while he was away on vacation  in egypt .  all efforts , made to reach the relatives of mr . patric zuma for the past  two years , have not yielded any positive result . it was later gathered  that mr . zuma ? s divorced wife died some two years ago in gaza .  in our last board meeting , the directors jointly decided that mr . zuma ? s  money should be included in the annual profit for the year 2005 . since  i was the one who introduced mr . zuma to the bank , i objected to the  decision and demanded that the fund remains floating in the treasury  for another one year to see if we could actually get the relatives of  mr . zuma to claim the money .  i am seeking your partnership to transfer this funds to your account  for your co - operation and assistance i willcompensate you with 25 %  70 % percent for me and 5 % set aside for any saundry expenses .  with your consent , we will put up a claim on your behalf as next of kin  to mr . zuma , iwill send you all the documents to you . once this is  done ,  the claims & verification dept will have the funds processed and wired to  your account , then we can meet to share the money together .  please i want you to keep this information very confidential as the  exposure of this information might even lead to my life imprisonment or  death . if you are not willing to assist me , then i will beg you to  still keep the informations secret .  let me have your telephone number so that i can reach you if you need  me to call you . i look forward to hearing from you soon . i am presently  in london on special duties .  thank you and regards  howard jones  alternative e - , mail addres : howard _ jones @ katamail . com",1
larry thorpe,"hi vince ,  been meaning to ask for your input about larry thorpe ' s proprietary model for  electricity returns . i have not been able to get much information about the  parameters as larry says the nature is proprietary . it is hard to make a  judgement about its usefulness without such information .  larry ' s e - mails to me indicate that he is working on npl 5 real time prices  and he promises to share the results with us . please advise on direction to  take as i am not quite sure about the model without further information .  separately , larry indicated that you had promised him some data and would  like to know if you have forwarded it to him . i can convey your position to  him .  thanks .",0

re : marketpoint license agreement,"dale ,  thanks for your message . in our phone conversation before the meeting you  mentioned  another contractual arrangement under which we could work with your company  employees on a case - study .  the cost of a weekly project would be $ 12 , 000 that would be applied to the  purchase price should  we go ahead and decide to acquire the software . this project would allow us  to evaluate the model and  come up with an estimate of the manpower necessary to support the model  internally .  please , let me know more about this option .  we are primarily interested in a long - term natural gas model and the database  for north america .  unless a familiarity with the short term model is a prerequisite , we don ' t  have resources to spend too much time on it .  of course , a trading desk may be interested in the short term  version of the model . i shall talk to them about it .  vince  "" dale m . nesbitt "" on 11 / 13 / 2000 06 : 00 : 05 pm  to : , "" vince . j . kaminski ""  cc :  subject : marketpoint license agreement  john / vince :  i really enjoyed the meeting the other day with you and a broad cross  section of your people . thank you very much for setting it up , and thank  you for giving me the opportunity to speak with your people .  as i mentioned to john , i am sending you the license paperwork for  marketpoint . i have attached our standard license agreement for your  consideration . as i mentioned , the license agreement covers the entire  bundled product , which includes  ? north american gas , short and long term  ? north american electricity , short and long term  ? world gas  ? western european gas  ? world oil  we are just finishing porting the world oil , world gas , and western european  gas models over from our old ( now obsolete ) software system into  marketpoint , so they will not be fully tested and complete for a couple of  months . however , the gas and electricity models for north america are  presently complete and tested . that should allow us to give you an  attractive price before the full worldwide toolkit is available throughout  your worldwide business .  as i understood it , you will want the gas modeling capability first and will  want to defer decisions on electric or other capability . as i mentioned at  the meeting , we are prepared to offer that for approximately  the fully  bundled price . as you read the license agreement , you will see that the  software licenses for $ 100 , 000 annually , the gas data for $ 5 , 000 , and the  electric data for $ 10 , 000 . marketpoint will agree to license you the gas  model plus the data for  the software license plus the data license for a  total of $ 55 , 000 annually . this is just under  the fully bundled price . i  think that is consistent with the discussions at our meeting , and from  marketpoint  , s perspective would provide a great basis to move forward  together with enron . if or when enron ever desires to  & scale up  8 to another  model or model ( s ) from the marketpoint portfolio , we will simply scale you  up to the entire license agreement . this will allow you to decouple the gas  decision from any other decisions you might make . ( i will be glad to put  this additional pricing provision into the agreement if you decide to move  forward . )  i felt i was able to communicate the philosophy , scope , and operation of our  approach during the meeting and to deliver you much of the information you  might need to evaluate whether marketpoint meets your needs . i thought you  were able to see the depth and sophistication of the product yet at the same  time its simplicity and effectiveness . i thought you were able to see the  benefits of the marketpoint dimension of economic equilibrium as a  complement and supplement to other approaches you will assuredly use . i  would be interested in your impressions and those of your colleagues . i  look forward to your response and to moving ahead together . we view you as  a very important prospective customer and client and will work with you to  earn and secure your business .  if you decide to license marketpoint , we can arrange to transfer and mount  marketpoint and the short term narg model ( which is the model we suggest you  begin with ) and travel to houston to deliver our 1  day training seminar .  our clients are usually very fluent after that 1  day training seminar .  thereafter , we would want you to work with the short term narg model for a  few weeks while you get up to speed , very fluent , and very comfortable  before you take delivery of the longer term version of narg several weeks  later .  thanks again , and all the best . if there is some item from the meeting that  i might have forgotten to send , please remind me . my notes don ' t show  anything , but i was speaking a lot rather than writing notes during the  meeting and might have overlooked something someone wanted .  dale nesbitt  president  marketpoint inc .  27121 adonna ct .  los altos hills , ca 94022  ( 650 ) 218 - 3069  dale . nesbitt @ marketpointinc . com  - license . doc",0

' s adgas and  oman lng contracts . basically what happens is that all the "" raw oil "" volumes  imported into japan and added up and the total price is divide by the total  volume , and there is a yen / us $ foreighn exchange component as well . that is  jcc . it was designed by the japanese so that they could tie their lng imports  to their average price of crude imports whereby the lng would be cheaper on  an mmbtu basis .  comments ?  brgds ,  marc  chris glaas  10 / 13 / 2000 03 : 11 am  to : marc de la roche / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : re : japanese crude cocktail & prompt brent  marc  regarding putting jcc on eol i get a negative respons from our sing office .  it is not a very liquid market . everyone is going the same way .  i understand there is good correlation between brent and jcc . i know little  about jcc , but if there is good correlation u should be able to hedge  yourself with brent . i need to know more about how jcc works in order to help  u , if u require any help at all ?  let me know  chris glaas  enron capital & trade resources corp .  from : marc de la roche 10 / 11 / 2000 03 : 16 pm  to : chris glaas / lon / ect @ ect  cc : doug leach / hou / ect @ ect , larry gagliardi / corp / enron @ enron  subject : japanese crude cocktail & prompt brent  chris ,  some of egm ' s lng group ' s lng is priced using a jcc - based formula . there ' s  also a lot of other lng contracts that use jcc as the pricing basis . in june  we obtained sign - off from vince kaminski ' s group to hedge jcc using prompt  brent ( see the messages with the relevant hedge ratio below ) . can we set up a  contract on eol , using the prompt brent - jcc hedge ratio , to hedge jcc ?  fyi , on a btu conversion basis :  therefore , to hedge 1000 mt of lng , a customer would need to transact on a  hedge for 9000 bbl of jcc . can we list a jcc swap in 9000 bbl / month  increments ?  thanks in advance ,  marc  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - forwarded by marc de la roche / hou / ect on 10 / 11 / 2000  08 : 32 am - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -  kevin kindall @ enron  06 / 06 / 2000 03 : 47 pm  to : marc de la roche / hou / ect @ ect  cc :  subject : re : jcc & brent  yes on both counts .  - kevin k .  from : marc de la roche @ ect 06 / 06 / 2000 02 : 50 pm  to : kevin kindall / corp / enron @ enron  cc : grant masson / hou / ect @ ect , vince j kaminski / hou / ect @ ect  subject : re : jcc  that this email constitutes your groups ( vince kaminski ' s ) sign - off on using  this hedge ratio to hedge jcc and jcc - based products ?  thanks in advance ,  marc de la roche  kevin kindall @ enron  06 / 06 / 2000 02 : 18 pm  to : marc de la roche / hou / ect @ ect  cc : grant masson / hou / ect @ ect  subject : re : jcc & brent  good afternoon . i have performed a review of the jcc data that you sent  some time ago . the study was done using several different excel workbooks ,  and are available upon request . relevant charts are embedded in the  powerpoint attachment . questions / comments welcome .  - kevin kindall",0

re : efa meetings,"hey vince ,  thanks for your reply . i ' ll see what becomes of the session and keep you  informed . as to the paper , tim crack and i have a revised version of the  paper i gave you . we have since found out that by using certainty  equivalence , our model is more robust . for example , if one has an asset  pricing model that incorporates mean , variance , and skewness ( harvey and  siddique , jf june , 2000 ) and a binomial model that incorporates mean ,  variance , and skewness ( johnson , paulukiewicz , and mehta , rqfa , 1997 ) , our  model allows you to price options under the real world measure . the  benefit is that one can take all of the model parameters from historical  data that is non - risk neutralized .  from a pricing perspective , there isn ' t a tremendous benefit in a  mean - variance world ( variance stays the same in risk neutral or risky  measure ) . however , in the mean - variance - skewness world , there is a benefit  because we do not believe ( although we ' re still hunting down an appropriate  cite ) skewness is the same under risk - neutral and risky measure . given we  can only measure the skewness in our risky world , our model becomes much  more significant .  i would certainly appreciate comments on the version of the paper you  have and would also pass on the new version of the paper if you would like  to see it .  thanks again ,  tom",0

re : anjam ' s term sheet,"tara :  i am forwarding it to vince for his approval . it looks good although i have  three questions :  1 ) i presume that it is clear that enron pays housing up to 1500 / month .  anjam does not get a check for 1500 to play with . utility bills are not  included unless part of the rent , right ? this should be clarified ; as you  know , houston summers are a significant burden on the pocket - book .  2 ) economy class plane . can we even do that ? i thought enron policy was for  a b - class ticket for flights over 6 hours .  3 ) 500 lbs of transport . i don ' t know if this is a big ticket item , but i  would give him less , 250 say , if it would save enron considerable expense .  regards ,  grant .",0

good day friend,"dear friend ,  my name is salim ibrahim a merchant in dubai , in  the u . a . e . i have been diagnosed with esophageal  cancer  it has defiled all forms of medical treatment , and  right now i have only about a few months to live ,  according to medical experts .  i have not particularly lived my life so well , as i  never really cared for anyone ( not even myself ) but  my business . though i am very rich , i was never  generous , i was always hostile to people and only focused on  my business as that was the only thing i cared for .  but now i regret all this as i now know that there is  more to life than just wanting to have  or make all the money in the world .  i believe when god gives me a second chance to come  to this world i would live my life a different way  from how i have lived it . now that god has called me , i  have willed and given most of my property and  assets to my immediate and extended family members as well  as a few close friends .  i want god to be merciful to me and accept my soul  so , i have decided to give also to charity  organizations , as i want this to be one of the last  good deeds i do on earth . so far , i have  distributed money to some charity organizations in the u . a . e ,  algeria and malaysia . now that my health has  deteriorated so badly , i cannot do this myself  anymore .  i once asked members of my family to close  one of my accounts and distribute the money which i  have there to charity organization in bulgaria and  pakistan , they refused and kept the money to  themselves . hence , i do not trust them anymore , as  they seem not to be contended with what i have left  for them .  the last of my money which no one knows of is the  huge cash deposit of ( twenty million five hundred  thousand u . s  dollars )  that i have with a finance / security  company abroad . i will want you to help me collect  this consignment and dispatched it to charity  organizations .  i have set aside 15 % for you .  god be with you .  salim ibrahim  note : please do get back to me via my private email  address at ibrahim _ salim @ ny . com  becuase i do not want my family to know anything  about this project , so i could give you the full details about  the funds .  please endeavour to get back to me via my specified  private  email address .  thanks for understanding . may the almighty allah  bless you  abondantly .  mail enviado desde el servicio webmail en el sitio | * btw * | call of duty  - . . /",1

re : got ink ? 21846,"what have you been up to ?  i don ' t know about you , but i am sick and tired of going  down to the store to find out that your printer cartridges  cost more than the printer itself ! i know how you feel  - i print over 500 pages a day , and it feels like there is  a vacuum sucking money out of my wallet ! now , this has got  to stop because i know it doesn ' t cost the printer companies  anywhere near what it costs me to do my office and school work !  well , it finally has . the superink solution .  you ' re probably thinking to yourself , "" gosh darn , not another  cheap knockoff printer cartridge ! "" like you , i was very  skeptical at first , but my best friend & business associate  said it helped her save over $ 100 a month on printer supplies .  so i tried it . i mean , there was nothing to lose because they  offer a 100 % satisfaction guarantee , up to a one - year warranty  on all of their products and free shipping on all orders !  let me tell you , it was one of the best decisions i ' ve ever made .  period . six months later , as i ' m writing this message to you ,  i ' ve gone from spending $ 1000 dollars a month on printer supplies  to now only $ 475 ! and i haven ' t had to sacrifice the quality or  service that i received from the local office supply store . in fact ,  the service is even better ! i ' ve had 1 defective cartridge since  i started dealing with superink and they sent me a new replacement  within 3 days , no questions asked . now , i can print all i want !  i was so happy with the results that i contacted their manufacturer  and got permission to be a reseller - at a big discount . i want  to help other people to avoid getting jipped by the printer companies  like i did . because a penny saved is a penny earned !  i give you my personal pledge the superink soltuion will absolutely  work for you . if it doesn ' t , you can return your order anytime  for a full refund .  if you are frustrated with dishing out money like it is water to the  printer companies , or tired of poor quality ink & toner cartridges ,  then i recommend - the superink solution .  you ' re probably asking yourself , "" ok , so how do we save all this money  without losing quality and service ?

organizational changes,"we are making a number of significant organizational changes . these changes  are intended to accomplish four key objectives :  first , we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successful  business model developed over the last decade in north america and europe .  this model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built  around a relatively small strategic asset position .  second , we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting  relationships . particularly with joe sutton  , s departure , the ability to  directly manage the day - to - day activities of 15 independent business units  has become increasingly difficult .  third , we need to accomplish these changes without , in any way , compromising  the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or  hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower - yielding  asset positions .  and fourth , as always , we need to take advantage of the reorganization to  redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities .  enron wholesale services  today , we are forming enron wholesale services ( ews ) which will consolidate  our global wholesale businesses . the closer alignment of our wholesale  businesses will accomplish the following : ( 1 ) enhanced communication and  coordination across business units , ( 2 ) more rapid deployment of people to  higher valued opportunities , ( 3 ) more effective prioritization of  opportunities across the wholesale business , and ( 4 ) more rapid extension of  enron  , s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries and  markets .  enron wholesale services will include our current north american , european  ( including japan and australia ) , global markets , and industrial markets  operations , and will be expanded to include enron  , s net works business unit  as well as a new unit  ) enron global assets . in addition , enron  , s merchant  businesses outside of north america and europe will be integrated into this  new structure as described below .  mark frevert , currently chairman of each of our wholesale units , will assume  the role of chairman and ceo of enron wholesale services . greg whalley ,  currently chairman and ceo of enron net works , will join mark in the office  of the chairman as president and chief operating officer .  providing further impetus for these organizational changes , several of our  international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadership  positions :  rebecca mcdonald , currently ceo of enron apachi , will join ews as president  and ceo of enron global assets . enron global assets will have responsibility  for managing all of enron  , s existing energy asset portfolio outside of north  america and europe . joining rebecca in the office of the chairman as coo  will be jim hughes , currently coo of enron apachi . rebecca and jim will  report to the ews office of the chairman .  sanjay bhatnagar , currently ceo of enron india , has joined ebs as ceo for the  middle east and asia region . sanjay will be responsible for building our  broadband business in this region and the current ebs team in this region  will report to sanjay . in this role , sanjay will report to the ebs office of  the chairman . in addition , sanjay will continue to remain responsible for  enron  , s wholesale energy business in india and will transition this business  into enron global assets in the near future .  diomedes christodoulou , currently co - ceo of enron south america , has joined  ebs as chief commercial officer . diomedes will be located in london and will  focus his origination activities on global opportunities , with near term  attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors . diomedes will report to  the ebs office of the chairman .  jim bannantine , currently co - ceo of enron south america , will be joining ees  to lead ees  , commercial efforts outside north america and europe . in order  to ensure a smooth transition for our south american businesses and to  facilitate our asset sales activities , jim will remain in south america for  at least the next several months and continue to serve as ceo of enron south  america . throughout the transition , jim will report to cliff baxter and to  the office of the chairman of enron wholesale services . following the  transition , jim will join ees .  in addition to these changes in our international asset operations  activities , we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale  businesses and the commercial support functions :  enron net works  louise kitchen will assume greg  , s previous responsibilities as president and  ceo of enron net works , reporting into mark and greg .  enron americas  concurrent with the transfer to enron global assets of responsibility for  operating enron  , s south and central america asset base , all trading ,  marketing , and new asset development activities in these regions will report  into a new entity , enron americas . enron americas will have responsibility  for all wholesale merchant businesses across north , central and south  america . dave delainey , president and ceo , and john lavorato , chief  operating officer will comprise the office of the chairman for enron  americas .  enron europe  the enron europe organization , which includes enron  , s businesses in australia  and japan , and enron metals , remains unchanged under the leadership of john  sherriff , president and ceo , and michael brown , chief operating officer .  enron global markets  enron global markets , under the leadership of mike mcconnell , president and  ceo , and jeff shankman , chief operating officer , will continue to have  responsibility for enron  , s middle east and lng operations . with the  exception of ecoelectrica in puerto rico , all operating power plants and  associated personnel in the caribbean and central america will transfer to  enron global assets . enron global markets will also continue to manage the  commodity businesses in crude and products , coal , weather , insurance ,  equities , interest rates , foreign exchange , and agricultural products .  enron industrial markets  enron industrial markets  , organization , under the leadership of jeff mcmahon ,  president & ceo , and ray bowen , chief operating officer , remains unchanged .  commercial support for ews  the commercial support functions for ews will remain with , and be managed by ,  the individual business units . we are creating no incremental overhead in  the creation of ews , and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more  efficient utilization and sharing of resources across ews .  to this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across  ews in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units . these  newly defined roles are as follows :  mid and back office operations  ) sally beck will lead mid and back office  operations across ews . these services will become part of enron net works ,  with sally reporting to louise kitchen and rick causey , executive vice  president and chief accounting officer . this alignment creates a coordinated  services organization with it and e - commerce platforms to support the  wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these  services . mid and back office services for all commercial activities will  continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible  for specific commodities and / or geographic locations .  legal  ) mark haedicke will serve in the role of general counsel for ews .  regulatory and government affairs  ) this function will remain organized on a  regional basis . rick shapiro will support all ews businesses operating in  the americas , and mark schroeder , who is based in london , will support all  european and eastern hemisphere operations . rick and mark will also continue  to support all other enron businesses operating in their respective regions  and will continue to report to steve kean , executive vice president and chief  of staff .  public relations  ) this function is also organized primarily on a regional  basis . eric thode will have responsibility for north american activity ,  enron net works , and enron industrial markets . jackie gentle will continue  in her role for enron europe ( including japan and australia ) and john ambler  will have responsibility for activity outside north america and europe as  well as providing support for enron global markets and enron global assets .  these individuals will also continue to have a split reporting relationship  to mark palmer , vice president of communications .  business analysis and reporting  ) wes colwell will expand his role to cover  ews reporting in addition to his current role in north america .  attached for your review is an organization chart for enron wholesale  services which summarizes the changes described here . as this organization  continues to evolve we will keep you informed of any additional changes .  enron global exploration and production  and enron wind  as part of our company - wide initiative to examine our assets and investments  around the world , we are considering a variety of options with respect to  egep and ewc . as a consequence , we are putting these businesses under cliff  baxter  , s direction . jeff sherrick , ceo of egep , and jim noles , ceo of enron  wind , will report to cliff .  corporate staff  we are consolidating the corporate staff functions : human resources ,  government affairs , public relations / communications and administration . in  that regard , cindy olson , executive vice president of human resources and  community relations , will report to steve kean , executive vice president and  chief of staff .  committee structure  in light of the increased leadership opportunities created by enron  , s  growth , the executive committee will be expanded to include more of our  business unit leaders . the primary role of this committee will continue to  be the communication of relevant information across enron  , s businesses and  the coordination of activities across those businesses . we will also be  drawing on this group to lead company -

urgent response,"dear sir / madam ,  you may be surprised to receive this letter from me , since you don ' t know me personally . i am mrs maria da costa the wife of dr . john da costa , who was recently murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe , i got your contact through network on line in my search for a reliable and reputable person to handle a very confidential transaction which involves a transfer of a fund to a foreign account and i decided to write you . my late husband was among the zimbabwean rich farmers murdered in cold blood by the agents of the ruling government of president robert mugabe for his alleged support and sympathy for the zimbabwean opposition party controlled by the white minority . before his death he deposited the sum of us $ 15 . 2 million ( fifteen million two hundred thousand us dollars ) to south africa with a security company as if he foresaw the looming danger in zimbabwe .  the money was deposited in a din box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from the security company . this money was embarked from the purchase of new machinery and chemical for farms and establishment of new farms in lesotho and swaziland . the land problem arose when president robert mugabe introduced a new land act that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few blacks vehemently condemned the "" modus operandi "" adopted by the government .  this resulted to rampant killing and mob action by the war veterans and some political thugs , precisely ; more than fifty - one ( 51 ) people have so far been killed . heads of governments from the west , especially britain and united states of america have voiced their condemnation of mugabe ' s plan , subsequently , south african development community ( s . a . d . c . ) has continuously supported mugabe ' s new land act , it is against this background that i and my  family who are currently residing in south africa have decided to transfer my husband ' s money into a foreign account . as a family , i am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account , where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who is tactically freezing of our family wealth .  and south africa ' s government seems to be playing along with them . i am faced with the dilemma of investing this money in south africa for fear of encountering the same experience in future since both countries have almost the same political history . more so , the south african foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment hence we are seeking for an "" asylum "" . as a business person whom i would entrust my future and that of my family into his hands , i must let you know that this transaction is 100 % risk free and that the nature of your business does not necessarily matter .  for your assistance , i will offering you 15 % of the total sum , 80 % for my family while 5 % will be mapped out for any expenses we may incur during the course of this transaction . i wish to  invest our part of the money on commercial property based on your advice .  finally , all i demand from you is assurance that you will not do away with this money when it finally gets to your personal or company ' s account in your country .  if this proposal is acceptable by you , please confirm your interest by contacting us on this phone number + 27724263169 or e - mail address mariadacosta _ 2002 @ yahoo . com  best regards ,  mrs maria da costa ( for the family )",1

"" in fact , the most recent similar  hire prior to that date was jose marquez , also a professional meteorologist ,  who was hired in , based on salary alignment criteria , as a manager . while  functionally , both these men are meteorologists , enron has no such job  classification . compounded by the urgency in bringing on additional  professional expertise in short time order , it was difficult to peg the  proper enron classification appropriate for this new position . this original  uncertainty and resulting misplacement of stephen into the specialist  category , rather than the senior specialist category , needs to be corrected  at this time .  although a "" new - hire "" to enron , stephen bennett has extensive work  experience . he has worked as a professional meteorologist at both the  weather services corporation in boston and at the weather channel in  atlanta . he came to enron well - referenced by both those organizations ,  needing no further training and only minimal supervision .  once aboard here in houston , stephen immediately demonstrated the core enron  values with our unique sense of urgency . after only a week , he assumed  responsibilities normally reserved for someone actually at even a manager  level - he was assigned and fully took over the critical afternoon weather  briefings to the gas traders . this includes analysis and report preparation  as well as presentation . also in the presentation arena , he now regularly  briefs various desks in the morning and throughout the day . stephen is a  master of communication and particularly adept at conveying what through  other messengers might otherwise seem confusing or ambiguous .  stephen has also demonstrated an unusually high level of self - initiative . he  designed , implemented , and now maintains several sub - sites on the research  web page which he tailored to various customers - in specific : the weather  derivatives team , the agricultural team , and most recently , the crude and  liquids team . i have recently assigned stephen to spearhead our conversion  and major upgrade of this web page .  these above described accomplishments are above and beyond stephen  , s regular  duties which include starting work at 5 am daily , reliably and without fail ,  to assemble and prepare our trader  , s weather report . recently , with the  advent of extended hours for both nymex and enrononline , stephen voluntarily  on his own accord , assists in our new sunday weather support effort . as his  supervisor , fully cognizant of his already standard 50 + hour work week , i do  not solicit , but readily accept , this above and beyond expectations  assistance .  in review , the circumstance which resulted in this under hire condition was  enron  , s immediate need for a non - standard , fairly unique professional - a  meteorologist , coupled with stephen  , s desire to work for our company in spite  of the absence of a hierarchy which included the exact entitled professional  title reflecting his chosen career path . . once hired , stephen has clearly  demonstrated through contribution and performance that he is well - deserving  of this immediate and retroactive promotion .",0
