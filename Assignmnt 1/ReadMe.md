# Assignment 1: Prototype
## Due: 6 Feb 2024
- Build a prototype for email spam classification
- In `prepare.ipynb`, write the functions to:
    - load the data from a given file path
    - preprocess the data (if needed)
    - split the data into train/validation/test 
    - store the splits at train.csv/validation.csv/test.csv
- In `train.ipynb` write the functions to:
    - fit a model on train data
    - score a model on given data
    - evaluate the model predictions
    - validate the model
    - fit on train
    - score on train and validation
    - evaluate on train and validation
    - fine-tune using train and validation (if necessary)
    - score 3 benchmark models on test data and select the best one
## Notes
1. You may download the email spam data from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jackksoncsie/spam-email-dataset
2. You may refer to https://radimrehurek.com/data_science_python/ for building a prototype. 
3. You may refer to first 3 chapters of https://www.statlearning.com/ for basic ML concepts.
4. You may refer to the Solution Design example covered in the class as a guideline for the experiment design.
